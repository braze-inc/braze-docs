<summary>Writing & Style Quick Tips</summary>

- Use the formatting shown on the [Styling Test Page](https://github.com/Appboy/braze-docs/blob/develop/_docs/_home/styling_test_page.md) to create unique templates and vehicles for your information.
- Use Action verbs!
- Capitalize proper nouns, unique Braze tools and features, custom Braze channels, and all Header titles.
- Redirect when necessary!
- Always speak to the Braze customer - refer to them as “you”, whether they are an Engineer/Developer, a Marketer, or an Admin.
- On Voice: You should aim to be a Friendly Professor. Imagine, if you will, the smartest, but also kindest professor you had. You know, the one who showed you your potential and tested you, but also went slowly in class so you could take great notes and learn some things? Don't be too peppy, but don't be formal. You’re not selling anything - you’re instructing and informing and enabling.

_Consult the [Docs Text Formatting Guide](https://github.com/Appboy/braze-docs/wiki/Special-Formatting) and the [Docs Writing Style Guide & Best Practices](https://github.com/Appboy/braze-docs/wiki/Writing-Style-Guide-&-Best-Practices) for more details._
