# General Instructions

These instructions are for contributors using GitHub Copilot to draft or edit documentation for Braze.

## Pull request titles

The title of the pull request should always match the corresponding issue title, which includes the pre-pended ticket number in the title as `[BD-NUMBER]` where `NUMBER` is the Jira ticket number listed in the corresponding issue. For example:

- **Issue:** `[BD-5016]:Update behaviour on link shortening when used with universal link`
- **PR Title:** `[BD-5016]:Update behaviour on link shortening when used with universal link`

## Pull request body

The pull request body should always use the [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE) as a base and add/edit the relevant sections in the template as needed. Specifically the Jira ticket number should always be linked using the following syntax:

```
- [BD-NUMBER](https://jira.braze.com/browse/BD-NUMBER)
```


## Voice and Tone

Our brand voice is smart, conversational, and direct. We are a human voice in a world of tech buzzwords; we provide clarity and guidance to anyone interested in the craft of customer engagement.

Clearly structure your writing and make it easy for people to find the information they need. To align on this brand voice in our writing and editing, use these guidelines:

- Explain complicated things simply.
- Be concise.
- Use consistent language for features and actions.

## What Not To Do

When describing Braze products and features, avoid the following:

1. References to future features, or suggestions that something may be supported in the future.
2. Using definitive terms such as "guarantee" or "ensure." Instead, use forward-looking statements like "designed to" or "intended to" to accurately convey the product's capabilities and intentions.
3. Using words and phrases that anchor your writing to a point in time, as they make content become quickly outdated. Focus on how the product works right now, not on what has changed (except for time-focused content, such as in release notes).
4. Specifically avoid the following words and phrases, as they make documentation less clear or more likely to become outdated:
   - as of this writing
   - currently
   - does not yet
   - eventually
   - future
   - in the future
   - latest
   - new
   - newer
   - now
   - old
   - older
   - presently
   - at present
   - soon

## Examples

- ❌ Incorrect: "This feature will be available in the future."
- ✅ Correct: "This feature is not supported."


# GENERAL GUIDELINES
## Voice and Tone
The Braze brand voice is smart, conversational, and direct. We are a human voice in a world of tech buzzwords; we provide clarity and guidance to anyone interested in the craft of customer engagement; and we eschew jargon in favor of concise language that is as easy to understand as it is powerful.


To align on this brand voice in our writing and editing, we use three voice guidelines: straightforward, empowering, and human.

### Straightforward
Clearly structure your writing and make it easy for people to find the information they need.

- Explain complicated things simply.
- Be concise.
- Use consistent language for features and actions.
  
#### Guidelines
✅ Use visuals to help clarify complex subjects.
Example: The user profile lifecycle image in the User Profile Lifecycle article helps to illustrate a tricky concept.

✅ Create a clear information hierarchy.
Example: "This is an overview for how content is managed on Braze Docs. To learn more about a specific topic, choose the dedicated topic page in the navigation."



✅ Ruthlessly cut jargon and acronyms if possible. If not possible, define them.
Example: "The Short Messaging Service (SMS) is used to send and receive brief text messages."

### Empowering
What problem are you trying to solve with your writing? Keep that problem in mind while creating any content.
- Explain the “why” and “how” to give users the confidence to take action.
- Be specific when explaining benefits, and be clear about what is and isn’t possible.
- Offer practical advice and sincere encouragement.
  
#### Guidelines
✅ Make it easy to find the happy path.

Example: "When you stop a Canvas, the following applies: 1. Users will be prevented from entering the Canvas. 2. No further messages will be sent out, despite where a user is in the flow.  3. **Exception:** Email Canvases won't immediately stop."


✅ Provide examples, use cases, and templates that simplify or elevate the user’s work.
Example: "`IInAppMessageManagerListener` also includes delegate methods for clicks on the message itself or one of the buttons. A common use case would be intercepting a message when a button or message is clicked for further processing."

### Human
Informational writing is inherently dry—we want readers to focus on the content, not the delivery. We can still write in a way that will help our readers process the information they’re consuming and make it more likely that they’ll internalize the knowledge. Be human, let your personality show, and be memorable.

- Aim for a conversational tone rather than a formal one.
- Focus on the user; respect their situation and emotional state.
- Actively center the human experience, not the machine state.
  
#### Guidelines
✅ Thoughtfully apply brand tone and assets.
Example: "Integrating with Braze is a worthwhile process. But you’re smart. You’re here. Clearly, you already know that."

✅ Apply accessibility best practices for both visual and verbal content.
Example: Replacing idioms like "out-of-the-box" with "default" make your text more accessible to English second language speakers.

✅ Provide consistent support across the user journey.
Example: Use the Diátaxis framework to ensure you’re meeting the needs of different users at different times.


## Accessibility
Braze aims to provide an inclusive experience. Use the following guidelines to ensure your learning content is accessible to the 1 billion people with an accessibility need.

### General
- Avoid biased or ableist language. For more information, see the section on Inclusive Language.
- Use a screen reader to test your content.
- Don’t use an ampersand (&) in place of “and” unless referencing UI elements that use an ampersand.
  
### Language and Formatting
- Use plain language.
- Front-load sections with the most important information. Use the journalism model of the inverted pyramid.
- Break up walls of text to help readers scan for information. Use paragraphs, lists, callouts, and images to improve readability.
- Write short sentences and paragraphs. As a general rule, aim for no more than 20 words per sentence, five sentences per paragraph.
- Avoid using Latin acronyms and phrases, as they can be hard to translate. Instead, use simple words or phrases.
  
### Headings
- Use unique, descriptive, and clear headings and titles.
- Use an h1 for page titles.
- Don’t skip heading levels. An h3 should follow an h2, and so on.
  
### Links
- Don’t use link text like “Learn more”, “here”, or “this document”. For more phrases to avoid, refer to the section Writing Links.
- Avoid placing two links back to back in a sentence. Put a character or word in between to separate them.
- Links to download files should indicate clicking the link will download the file, as well as the file type (PDF, CSV, etc.)
- If it isn’t clear from the context, links to sections in the same document should use a standard phrase indicating this action.

### Images, Videos, and GIFs
- Provide alt text for every image that summarizes the information presented in the image.
- Don’t use images as the only way to show information. Always provide the steps, content, or other details presented in the image in the surrounding text.
- Don’t use images of terminal output, code samples, or text. Instead, use actual text.
- Provide captions for video content.
- Don’t use flashing elements in videos or GIFs.

### Tables
- Always use an introductory sentence to describe the purpose of the table.
- Avoid tables in the middle of a list, especially a list of steps.

## Global Audience
We write our learning content in American English. However, Braze is a global brand, and as such, we write for a global audience. Use the following guidelines to make sure customers understand your writing even when English isn’t their first language.

- Write with localization in mind:
   - Format dates and times in unambiguous ways.
   - Don’t put text overlays on images, as this text can’t be translated.
   - Avoid slang and idioms.
   - Provide context. Don’t assume the reader knows what you’re talking about.
- Write short and precise sentences:
   - Use plain language.
   - Define abbreviations.
   - Avoid ambiguous pronouns. If a pronoun may be ambiguous, then replace it with the appropriate noun.
- Be consistent:
   - Use the same term for a concept across all mentions of the term, including the same capitalization and text formatting.
   - Write sentences in subject + verb + object order.
   - If instructions depend on a condition being met, put the conditional clause first. For more information, see clause order.
- Be inclusive:
   - Use inclusive language.
   - Use diverse example names.
   - Avoid culturally specific humor.

## Inclusive Language
We may be a B2B company, but people are at the center of what we do, and ours is a global brand. Whenever we refer to a person in our content, we are mindful of being inclusive and considerate. When in doubt, consult this section or The Diversity Style Guide.

### Age
- Unless it’s relevant to your writing, don’t refer to a subject’s age. Don’t use qualifiers like “young” or “old” to describe any subject or audience.
- If you’re representing an age group, be descriptive and specific like “Generation Z” instead of “youth.” Don’t use vague descriptors like “college-age” when you could say “college students” instead.

### Color
Avoid including color terms in your writing unless absolutely necessary, and if necessary, include explanatory text.

- ✅ Correct: Press Save.
- ✅ Correct: Press the green Save icon.
- ✅ Correct: Press the green checkmark icon.
- ❌ Incorrect: Press the green icon.
- ❌ Incorrect: Press the green icon next to the red Cancel button.

Don’t rely on color to be the only indicator for interactive elements. For example, underline links on hover, or mark a required field with an asterisk.

Avoid relying solely on green and red for “good” and “bad” (or, more often, “do” and “don’t”) indicators. Red/green color blindness is the most common type of color blindness. If you use color to communicate do’s and don’ts, make sure to also include other text or symbols to convey the same point.

### Condescending Language
When writing instructions or detailing steps for a reader to follow, avoid using words or phrases such as:
- simple, like “Creating a campaign is simple.”
- simply, like “...simply add X into Y”
- just, like “...just install X”
- “It’s easy”

If someone has difficulty with the steps or instructions, your casual descriptors can feel condescending. You may also unintentionally exclude people from your documentation who interpret that as an indicator they are in some way not skilled enough to follow your instructions.

### Customers vs. Clients
When referring to Braze users and their consumers, use the following terms accordingly:

- Customers: Brands we work with. Never refer to our customers as “clients”.
   - Braze users: In the context of documentation, when it is important to distinguish between users of the platform and the end users who receive marketing messages, use "Braze users".
- Consumers: Customers of a brand we work with.
- Users: Generally reserved for a specific statistic that depends on “user” metrics (such as “user retention”). When referring to “users” in our content, first aim to be more specific. Think shoppers, consumers, patients, players, etc.

### Departments and Teams
Capitalize the names of departments or teams. Do not capitalize “team” or “department.”

- ✅ Correct: Marketing, Business Intelligence
- ✅ Correct: Product team, Revenue department
- ❌ Incorrect: marketing, business intelligence
- ❌ Incorrect: Product Team, Revenue Department
 
### Disability
Don’t refer to a person’s disability unless it’s specifically relevant to your writing. In that case, be considerate and ask whether the subject prefers identity-first or person-first language. When referring to a subject with a disability, do not use terms like “handicapped.”


Ableist language includes words or phrases such as “crazy”, “insane”, “blind to” or “blind eye to”, “cripple”, “dumb”, and others. Choose alternative words depending on the context.

### Disease
When describing an illness, avoid words like “suffer,” “struggle,” or “victim.” Aim to be neutral and matter-of-fact.

- ✅ Correct: She was diagnosed with cancer.
- ✅ Correct: They’re living with HIV.
- ✅ Correct: He recovered from his stroke.

### Inclusivity in Content
Highlight and represent a diverse community. Be mindful and inclusive when involving our customers, speakers, industry experts, and Braze team members.

### Job Titles
When it comes to job titles, we veer off-course from AP Style. In all cases, we capitalize job titles when referring to someone specifically.

#### Job Title with Company Name
Capitalize formal job titles when they come before or after a person’s name. We format them three ways:

- ✅ Correct: [Formal Title] at [Company Name] + [Full Name]
- ✅ Correct: Creative Director at PantsLabyrinth David Bowie
- ❌ Incorrect: creative director at PantsLabyrinth David Bowie

- ✅ Correct: [Full Name] + comma + [Formal Title] at [Company Name] 
- ✅ Correct: David Bowie, Creative Director at PantsLabyrinth

- ❌ Incorrect: David Bowie, creative director at PantsLabyrinth

- ✅ Correct: [Company Name] + [Formal Title] + [Full Name] 
- ✅ Correct: PantsLabyrinth Creative Director David Bowie
- ❌ Incorrect: PantsLabyrinth creative director David Bowie

#### Job Title without Company Name
When referring to a specific person by formal title, capitalize their formal title and name like so:

- ✅ Correct: [Formal Title] + [Full Name]
- ✅ Correct: CEO Robin Fenty
- ❌ Incorrect: Chief executive officer Robyn Fenty

- ✅ Correct: [Formal Title] + comma + [Full Name]
- ✅ Correct: SVP, Product, Robin Fenty
- ❌ Incorrect: senior vice president, product, Robyn Fenty

#### Other
Formal titles are “at [COMPANY].” Founders and Cofounders are “of [COMPANY].” Formal titles and occupations on their own do not need to be capitalized.

- ✅ Correct: I wrote to their chief data officer.
- ✅ Correct: We spoke with several business intelligence analysts.
- ✅ Correct: Contact your Braze account manager.
- ❌ Incorrect: I wrote to their Chief Data Officer
- ❌ Incorrect: We spoke with several Business Intelligence Analysts.
- ❌ Incorrect: Contact your Braze Account Manager.

- ✅ Correct: Adhere to gender-neutral job titles unless gender has been already established.
- ✅ Correct: salesperson
- ❌ Incorrect: salesman/saleswoman

Abbreviate titles where appropriate, such as VP or SVP, if this is how the person refers to their title. In the event of limited text space, standard abbreviations (VP, SVP, Sr., or Jr.) are acceptable.

### Gender
- Don’t make assumptions about people’s gender. Ask subjects who will appear in your content how they self-identify.
- When referring to members of the community, “queer” is acceptable. “Gay” is not. You may refer to a group of people as “LGBTQ.” Do not use this for describing an individual.
- When addressing groups of people in your content, avoid gendering your audience (example: “OK, ladies!”). Use gender-neutral expressions instead (example: “Let’s dig in, everyone!”).
- “They/them/theirs” is always acceptable to use as a single or plural pronoun in all of our content.

### Mental Health
Mental health and illness cover a broad range of conditions. Unless it’s relevant to what you are writing, don’t refer to a person’s mental health. Avoid stigmatizing words and phrases. Don’t use medical terms colloquially (example: “The depressing state of things...”).

### Names
The first time you mention a person, use their first and full name. From there on, use either their first or last name when referring to them.

### Pronouns
For information on appropriate use of pronouns, refer to the Language and Grammar section on Pronouns.

### Race, Religion, and Ethnicity
Don’t refer to a person’s race, religion, or ethnicity unless it’s relevant to what you are writing. In writing where race or ethnicity factors in, ask your subject how they self-identify.

Don’t use a hyphen to indicate dual heritage or religion. Instead, use a space.

- ✅ Correct: Muslim American
- ✅ Correct: Cuban American
- ❌ Incorrect: Muslim-American
- ❌ Incorrect: Cuban-american

Capitalize the proper names of ethnicities, nationalities, peoples, and tribes.

- ✅ Correct: Cambodian
- ✅ Correct: Black Americans
- ❌ Incorrect: cambodian
- ❌ Incorrect: black Americans

Capitalize the names of religions or religious terms.

- ✅ Correct: Bahá’í Faith
- ✅ Correct: Buddhist
- ❌ Incorrect: bahá’í faith
- ❌ Incorrect: buddhist

Don’t co-opt words or turns of phrases that belong to African American Vernacular English (on fleek, bae, lit, woke).

Don’t co-opt words or turns of phrases specific to indigenous peoples (example: spirit animal, powwow).

### Third-Party Sources
Never copy content from other sites, as it may violate copyright. Content can be both text and images.

Instead of copying or quoting third-party sites, paraphrase the content or provide a link to the third-party site for more information.  For more information, refer to Links to Other Sites.


# LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR
Keeping in line with agreed-upon grammar and mechanics helps us keep our writing clear and consistent. This section covers what we try to follow in our technical documentation unless specified otherwise.

## Abbreviations
Abbreviations, such as acronyms, initialisms, and shortened words, can hurt our clarity, voice, and SEO.

Although some abbreviations are widely understood, others aren't well known or are familiar only to a specific group of customers. Use your best judgment, and as a general rule, it’s OK not to spell out an abbreviation if it’s listed in the American Heritage Dictionary.

If an abbreviation isn’t well known, spell it out on the first mention, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. For all subsequent mentions of the term, use the abbreviation.

- ✅ Do: Spell out uncommon abbreviations at the first mention.
- ✅ Correct: Top-level domain (TLD)
- ✅ Correct: Universally unique identifier (UUID)
- ❌ Don't: Spell out common abbreviations.
- ❌ Incorrect: Portable Document Format (PDF)
- ❌ Incorrect: Universal Serial Bus (USB)

Treat abbreviations as regular words when making them plural, and don't add an apostrophe—for example, APIs and SDKs. The same goes for which article (a or an) you use—look at how you pronounce the abbreviation. When an abbreviation begins with a vowel sound, use “an”; for consonant sounds, use “a”.

- ✅ Correct: an ISP
- ✅ Correct: a DLL
- ✅ Correct: an HTML site
- ✅ Correct: a CSV file

Do use articles depending on how the abbreviation is pronounced, not spelled.


## Active Voice
We use the active voice at Braze when possible. Active voice is our gold standard. Avoid passive voice, in which it can be difficult to determine who or what is performing a particular action.


To see if your sentence is in a passive voice, insert “by somebody” after the verb. If the sentence makes sense—it’s most likely in the passive voice.


Braze connects consumers to the brands they love.

Braze requires employees to keep their addresses up to date.

Company administrators can configure authentication requirements for signing into Braze.

 

Do

Use active voice.



Consumers are connected to the brands they love.

Employees are required to keep their addresses up to date.

Authentication requirements for signing into Braze can be configured by company administrators.

 

Don’t

Use passive voice, if possible.

Exceptions
It’s OK to use passive voice in the following cases:

To de-emphasize a subject, generally to avoid blaming the reader:
Do: Two errors were found in the email.
Don’t: You created two errors in the email.
If knowing who is responsible for the action isn’t important:
Do: This article was last updated in December 2020.
Articles
Use the articles “a”, “an”, and “the” to make your writing clear and to aid in translation. Use “the” before a specific singular or plural noun, and “a” or “an” before a non-specific singular noun.


To determine if you should use “a” or “an”, look at the pronunciation of the word that follows it. Use “a” before a consonant sound, and use “an” before a vowel sound. The same guidelines apply to Abbreviations.

Do

Use articles depending on how the anteceding word is pronounced.


Pronouns
Personal Pronouns
Use second-person pronouns (you) whenever possible.


Don’t refer to Braze customers as the “user” in external-facing writing, instead speak directly to the reader using “you”. To refer to our customers’ customers, use “your consumers” or, if the situation relates to user statistics, “your users”.


Avoid first-person pronouns (I, we, us, our) except in the following cases:

Entries in FAQs. For example, “How do I reset my password?”.
Using “we” to refer to Braze as an organization.
If it may be unclear who “we” is referring to, first refer to Braze by name, then use “we” in subsequent mentions.
Gender-Neutral Pronouns
Use the pronouns your subjects use. If there is any uncertainty, use “they,” “them,” and “their” for singular pronouns. Don’t use “he/she” or “(s)he” as an alternative to the singular “they”.  


Only use gendered pronouns (he/she, him/her, his/hers) if the person you’re referring to is actually that gender.  

Ambiguous Pronouns
Pronouns substitute for nouns. The word a pronoun refers to is called its antecedent. When writing instructions or learning material, be sure to make clear references between a pronoun and its antecedent. This may require repeating subjects to make the meaning clear.


If you type text in the field, the text doesn’t change.

She told Sarah that Sarah’s answer was incorrect.

You can’t edit an archived campaign. Unarchive a campaign to edit it.

 

Do

Make sure a pronoun clearly references its antecedent.


If you type text in the field, it doesn’t change.

She told Sarah that her answer was incorrect.

Don’t

Use ambiguous pronoun references.

Optional Pronouns
To add additional clarity to your writing and to aid in localization, use pronouns such as “that”, “which”, and “who”.

Use “that”, “which”, and “who” to add additional clarity.


Right-click the link you want to open.

Capitalization
Avoid unnecessary capitalization. In most instances, use sentence case. Title case should only be used for proper nouns or feature names (unless otherwise specified, see Glossary).

Brands and Products
When referring to a brand or product, use the capitalization the brand uses. In most cases, capitalize the names of brands (Grindr, Walmart) and products (Benchmarks, Looker Blocks). It’s fine to begin a sentence with lowercase if the first word is the stylized name of a brand like eBay or iTunes.


For intercaps, always refer to the usage preferred by the brand in print (OkCupid, YouTube). Do not use intercaps that only appear in logos or graphic design treatments (Amazon).

Clause Order
If you want to tell the reader to do something in a specific circumstance, try to mention the circumstance before you provide the instruction. This lets the reader skip the instruction if the circumstance doesn't apply.

Combining Forms
Hyphenate combined forms when the phrase is used as an adjective before the noun.


Example: A one-of-a-kind item

Contractions
A contraction is a shortened version of a word or phrase. Use contractions to keep an approachable and informal tone. However, do not use noun and verb contractions or double contractions, or a combination of two contractions. These can disrupt the flow and coherency of the sentence.


If you’re an admin, you can manage your company’s contact information.

You can’t edit an archived campaign.



Do

Use contractions.


Braze’ll now support Shoptify integration.

You mightn’t’ve seen the restricted upload size.


Don’t

Use noun and verb contractions.

Dangling and Misplaced Modifiers
Modifiers are words of phrases that modify other words or phrases. A dangling modifier doesn’t modify any subject in the sentence. A misplaced modifier is placed far away from the subject that it’s meant to modify. Essentially, dangling and misplaced modifiers may cause confusion by connecting to the wrong part of the sentence.


Writing with an active voice will help prevent the use of dangling and misplaced modifiers. Be sure to use a modifier that clearly modifies.


Customers need to set up their SAML settings.

Make sure to save your campaign drafts.


Do

Keep sentences short and concise. Use active voice.


You may have test messages on your campaigns that can be deleted.

On the way home, Sarah found a gold man’s stopwatch.


Don’t

Use lengthy sentences with modifiers that can cause confusion.

Prepositions
There’s nothing wrong with ending a sentence in a preposition when it improves readability. Place a preposition or prepositional phrase where it makes the most sense in a sentence. If you’re having difficulty, read the sentence out loud and see if it sounds natural.


Each option corresponds to the priority the notification will be displayed in.

Present Tense
Use present tense instead of future tense. Present tense conveys immediacy and demonstrates confidence. Avoid using “will” or hypothetical “would”, especially when referring to the result of user action.

Don’t


Only use future tense when you’re actually talking about the future. Avoid predicting future features. 

Profanity
Keep it PG. This has less to do with morality than the fact profanity can be divisive and off-putting to an audience as broad and international as ours. There’s also a case to be made that sometimes profanity is a cover-up for half-baked writing. That’s simply not our vibe.

Plurals in Parentheses
Do not use plurals in parentheses. Instead, use the plural or singular form of the word.

Do


Don’t

When using second person, make sure you know who the audience of the document is, and to be consistent about who you’re talking to.

Slang and Idioms
We’re a plainspoken bunch. Avoid using trendy slang or idioms that speak too specifically to a singular audience. It can also quickly date materials, and make it difficult to localize content.

Spelling
Use American English spelling for words that differ in British English. If you’re not sure how to spell a word, first refer to the Glossary. If the word isn’t listed there, then refer to Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary.


For words that are accented or contain special characters, make sure to correctly follow the dictionary spelling. In some cases, unintentionally omitting these accents can result in a different word. For example, “resume” means to begin again after stopping, whereas “résumé” is an account of one’s qualifications.


PUNCTUATION
Ampersands
Don’t use an ampersand (&) in place of “and” in text or headings unless you are referring directly to the user interface.

Apostrophes
We use an apostrophe most often to make a noun possessive.


For singular nouns that end in S, it’s fine to place another S after the apostrophe.
Example: Chris’s, business’s, alias’s
For plural nouns that end in S, add an apostrophe but no additional S.
Example: users’
Colons
Use colons at the end of an introductory phrase that precedes a list or example. Your introductory sentence should be able to stand alone as a complete sentence. This is for both accessibility and localization purposes, as it’s difficult to translate sentence fragments.

The general structure is as follows:


The general structure is:

Don’t

If the text preceding the colon is bold, bold the colon as well.

user_alias_label: A common label to group user aliases with.

Do


Don’t

You can also use a colon to join two related phrases in a sentence. However, use colons for this sparingly. Two sentences are generally more readable.

Coming up next week: we’ll go on a tour of the West Village.


Do


Commas
Braze uses the Oxford (serial) comma when writing instructions or learning content. Use a comma before the last conjunction to separate items in a series.


Use a comma after an introductory phrase.


If a coordinating conjunction (words like “and”, “but”, “or”, “yet”, “so”) separates two independent clauses, place the comma after the first clause and before the conjunction. However, this comma is not necessary if both clauses are short.


For example, here are two independent clauses:

“All fields are optional.”
“You must specify at least one field.”
The sentence when using a coordinating conjunction “but” is “All fields are optional, but you must specify at least one field.”


If an independent clause and a dependent clause are used in the same sentence, do not use a comma to separate them. Only use a comma in this scenario if the sentence can be misinterpreted without the comma placement.

Dashes
Em Dash
Use an em dash (—) when using a dash in a sentence to indicate a separate thought or interruption. Don’t put any spaces before or after the em dash. Don’t use an em dash where a comma or parenthesis would work just as well.

Refer to your operating system for how to type an em dash:

macOS: Press Option + Shift + Hyphen.
Windows: Turn num lock on, then hold down the left Alt key and type 0151 on the num pad.

Ellipses
An ellipsis is a series of three periods (...) that indicates an omission of one or more words. In general, avoid using ellipses when possible while writing instructions or learning content.

Exclamation Points
An exclamation point can be used sparingly for an informal tone. However, avoid overly using exclamation points throughout text. Instead, consider using Alerts.


Be sure to save your changes before leaving the page!


Do

Use exclamation points for an informal tone for reminders and introductions.


Users must receive one or more messages from a step to be counted as a unique recipient!


Don’t

Use exclamation points for indicating warning or caution to readers.

Hyphens
Hyphens can help the reader gain more clarity in a sentence by linking words in a phrase together. Here are a few guidelines for getting it right.

Use hyphens for compound modifiers that will help the reader understand the subject more clearly.

Do

Use hyphens to link a phrase, with a space between the modifier and subject.

All-in-one solutions

Do


Use hyphens for a phrase that modifies a subject. There’s no need to use a hyphen if the phrase is the subject.

Parentheses
Use parentheses sparingly. Never put important information in parentheses, as some readers skip content in parentheses.

For less important parentheticals, consider reworking the sentence to remove the parentheses. For example, you can set off the phrase or sentence using commas, dashes, semicolons, or by adding a new sentence.


If a parentheses is part of a larger sentence, place the period outside of the parenthesis. If the parentheses contain a complete sentence, place the period inside.


Related section: Plurals in Parentheses

Periods
Use a period to end sentences. Do not use a period to end headlines, headings, subheadings, or UI elements.


For guidelines on when to use periods with list items, refer to Lists.

Semicolons
Semicolons are great for breaking up a longer, more complicated sentence. Use a semicolon to separate two independent clauses that are closely related in topic.

The cat slept through the storm; the dog cowered under the bed.

Do

Use a semicolon to break up a sentence with two related independent clauses.

Semicolons can be used to separate list items if one (or more) of the list items contains a comma.

Jane Lang, our moderator; Simon Mayer, CEO and Cofounder of PantsLabyrinth; and Kara Seberg, CMO of Yachtr.

Do

Use a semicolon to break up a longer
sentence.

Slashes
There are two types of slashes: backward (\) and forward (/). Do not use slashes to indicate alternative words or examples (“and/or”).


Use slashes as needed in file paths and URLs.

/campaigns/data_series

Do

Use a slash for file paths.

you/your customers

Don’t

Use a slash to separate alternatives.

Quotation Marks
There are two types of quotation marks: straight (" ") and curly (“ ”). Periods and commas go inside the quotation marks. An exception is when the quotation marks include exact information such as a string. Use quotation marks when directing users to input a specific string of text into a text field.

Note: When describing search syntax, quotation marks are often used to signify searching for exact text. In this case, use brackets around the string of text and quotation marks as required by the search syntax. For example:


Put quotes around any word or phrase, such as [“test segment”], and we’ll only show results that contain those exact words or phrases.

 

Code examples must use straight quotation marks. For more information about formatting code in text, refer to Code in Text.

TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION
API Endpoints
In general, documentation for API endpoints should follow the guidelines in this style guide. However, there are niche topics that may require different content guidelines listed in this document. For more information on how to format and reference endpoints, refer to API Endpoint Documentation Guidelines. 

Avoid Guarantees
Our documentation must refrain from making commitments that could potentially result in legal implications. Avoid using definitive terms such as "guarantee" or "ensure." Instead, employ forward-looking statements like "Designed to" or "Intended to" to accurately convey the product's capabilities and intentions.

Describing Interactions with the UI
When referring to UI elements, match the capitalization as it appears in the UI. However, If a label is all caps, use sentence case (exception: short labels, like AND or OR operators).


When instructing a reader to interact with the UI, bold the UI element they are interacting with. For strings that a user would enter into a field, use quotation marks.


For guidance on what verbs to use when describing interactions with the UI, refer to the following table:

Verb

Usage

Describing Limitations
Write candidly about the product's limitations, without distortion or manipulation. Readers will react in an intense fashion to being manipulated, hoodwinked, and otherwise bamboozled, and this will jeopardize the documentation's efficacy as a source of utilitarian truth. Customers rely on documentation to understand the limits of the system to which they are building so that they can use Braze successfully.


At the same time, support the intentionality of the product's development by framing limitations with appropriate, positive context.

If there is a soft limitation (for example, an API rate limit), frame the limitation by talking about the default limit or starting allotment.
Provide a meaningful path forward to navigate soft limits. Provide examples of these workarounds as appropriate.
For example, Braze uses sizing exercises during onboarding to help customers understand how things such as data points are used by other businesses of a similar size. When discussing data points, it is appropriate to talk about the sizing exercise at the same time.
It is better to describe a path forward in a positive way than as a mitigation.
For example, instead of saying "Braze does not allow customers to do this on their own. The Support team must activate this feature for you," say, "To activate this feature, contact the Support team."
Do not over-rely on the same stock phrases to navigate soft limits. If a user reads "Talk to your customer service representative" over and over, the advice becomes meaningless.
If there is a hard limitation, try to describe the rationale behind this limit.
For example: "There is a limit of 200 active, action-based in-app message campaigns per app group to optimize the speed of message delivery and to prevent timeouts. …The average Braze customer has a total of 26 campaigns active at once—so it's unlikely that this limitation will impact you."
Do not describe planned functionality or future features as a way to explain current limitations.
Future Features
Avoid references to future features, or suggestions that something may be supported in the future.

Don’t use words and phrases that anchor your writing to a point in time, as they make content become quickly outdated. Focus on how the product works right now, not on what has changed (except for time-focused content, such as in release notes).


Specifically avoid the following list of words and phrases, taken from Google’s developer documentation style guide:

as of this writing
currently
does not yet
eventually
future, in the future
latest
new, newer
now
old, older
presently, at present
soon

Features Deprecations
Before including information about feature deprecations, be sure you have a general time frame of when readers can expect the feature to be deprecated (for example, late 2025).


After you have a general time frame, communicate the feature deprecation early. Be clear in writing about deprecations so that readers can clearly understand what to expect.


Don't use phrases that might incite fear, uncertainty, or doubt with readers. Provide a clear path forward, such as what the deprecated feature will be replaced by or an alternative solution.


General vs Specific
As a best practice, write articles that discuss functionality in a generally applicable way. If more detail is needed for specific cases or exceptions, create a separate section (or separate article if the content is web article length, ~500 words) that outlines this outlier. Create cross-references from the general article to the specific to help users connect these concepts.


Avoid creating duplicated or repetitious content for different channels or features. If repetition is needed, use `includes` files and other reusable content best practices.


As an example: A common use case for Braze customers is to retarget users who have previously interacted with their messaging. Retargeting users can be done through many engagement tools, including campaigns, Canvases, landing pages, and segments. Retargeting users can be done through many channels: WhatsApp, SMS, Content Cards, email, push notifications, etc. Often, customers will try to reengage a user through a separate channel than one previously used.

Instead of creating one article for each engagement tool and each channel, create a single article that discusses strategies for retargeting users and outlines all the options available. If there are special considerations for specific channels/tools, create a separate article that outlines those considerations and house it within that documentation section. Create cross-references between the general article and the specific article.

Metadata and YAML
Articles in Braze documentation require certain metadata for search and index purposes. For information on what metadata is required, refer to the GitHub page on YAML and Metadata Layouts.

Naming Conventions
When naming articles and filenames, make sure to describe the general topic in the title. Always include a keyword and brief description that will be easily understood by readers, especially with article titles.

For filenames, keep the name brief and avoid using articles (a, an, the). Separate each word with an underscore (_).

Do


In general, for articles and image files, use the same spelling and capitalization as the referenced article and files. For guidelines on article title styling, refer to Headings and Titles.


When referring to a specific file, use the same spelling of the filename and code font. For formatting details, refer to the GitHub page on Special Formatting.



Procedures and Instructions
This section covers some guidelines to keep in mind when writing instructions for procedures in the Braze dashboard.


General guidelines:

Use the right tone. For instructions, keep your writing short, to the point, and task-oriented. Your writing doesn’t need to be terse or dry, but it should be direct. When introducing tasks or subtasks, you can use a more informal tone to add variety. Avoid using “please” to keep the tone informal. Make liberal use contractions to keep your tone approachable.
Follow parallel heading format. Pick one format for your headings and stick to it. Keep your content scannable and predictable. In general, use gerunds (ing-words) for page titles, and imperative verbs for task-based headings.

Before instructions:

Use introductions and prerequisites. Don’t jump straight into the steps. Instead, give context on what your article or section will cover, and provide any information the reader needs to know before they scan the instructions. Make sure any prerequisites are listed at the top of the document.
Start at the beginning of the procedure. Don’t assume the reader has reached this page after completing a previous step. If the instructions for a task pick up where another left off, give an overview of where the reader is in the procedure, and what they must complete before this step. Include links to any previous steps.

Writing instructions:

Use actionable language. Structure documentation around what the user can do, not what the product can do. Avoid language like “This feature [does xyz]”. Instead, think in terms of “Use this feature to [do xyz]”.
Provide location steps when needed. Make sure the reader is looking in the right place with brief phrases such as “On the Settings page, click Edit.” If that may not be clear enough, provide an introductory step. For example, “Go to Manage Settings and select the Settings tab.”
Preface conditional statements. Put conditional clauses first. For conditional instructions, preface the step with “if” so the reader knows they can skip the step if the condition doesn’t apply to them. For example, “If you need X, then do A > B > C.”
Reinforce task order. For progress within a series of steps, use the phrase “When you’ve” or “After you’ve”. For progress between tasks, begin a section with “Now that you’ve” or “After you’ve”. Avoid the phrase “Once you’ve”, as that specific use of “once” doesn’t translate well.
Tabs
Tabs can be used in technical documentation as a way to organize grouped information.


A tab refers to an element that can be used when writing instructions to demonstrate a workflow summary or to organize grouped information. This is similar to a table or list, but the information is grouped into panels.


Consider using tabs when information can be grouped together to avoid duplication or to visualize a workflow for readers. Ensure that the tabs include parallel information, and are not used for when the reader must follow sequential steps in a workflow.


For example, you can use tabs to show code examples in different programming languages. In this case, a reader would toggle between the examples based on the tab labels as opposed to scrolling through the article.


For formatting details, refer to the GItHub page on Special Formatting. Alternatively, you can also use a list or table to organize information.



FORMATTING AND ORGANIZING
Addresses
Use the numeral followed by the street name like so:


330 W. 34th St.


To display a full address, use the numeral, followed by the street name, followed by the city, state, and zip code. There’s no need for a comma between the state and zip code.


330 W. 34th St., New York, NY 10001

Buttons Labels
Button labels should be clear and predictable—the user should know what action will occur upon clicking the button. Use sentence case for button labels, and lead with a strong verb. If it may be unclear what the verb is referring to, use the format [verb] + [noun].

Omit unnecessary words and articles, such as “a”, “an,” or “the”.

Callouts and Alerts
Alerts, also known as callouts, are used to draw attention to information that is helpful to the reader. There are four alerts types that are used in our documentation:

Important
Note
Tip
Warning
Use alerts sparingly throughout articles. For more information, refer to Best Practices for Alerts.

Code in Text
There are a few scenarios where you should use code font to format text within a sentence. Here is an incomplete list of items that should be in code font:

Attribute names and values
API request parameters
Filenames
File paths
Method, variable, or parameter names
HTML and XML element names
HTTP status codes
Text input into a terminal
To create in-line code text in Braze documentation, surround the text in backticks (`).

Code Samples
Code samples refer to blocks of code text that display a sample snippet of code. For accessibility purposes, introduce the code sample with an expository sentence where possible.

To make sure your code samples are legible, indent each line by two spaces per indentation level. If you’re having trouble formatting your code samples, try prettifying your code using a pretty print formatter, such as JSON Formatter.

To create code blocks in Braze documentation, refer to Code Snippet Test. Remember that code blocks should specify the language type to ensure proper syntax highlighting.

Dates and Times
Spell out the month and days of the week. Avoid abbreviations when possible. For instances when abbreviating months are required, only abbreviate the following:

Jan.
Feb.
Aug.
Sept.
Oct.
Nov.
Dec.

Use a comma to separate the date from the year. If a day of the week is used with the date, add it before the month.

September 2021

September 15, 2021

Wednesday, September 15, 2021

Do

Use the preferred date format.


For date ranges, use an en dash.


2010–2021

Do

Use an en dash for date ranges.


Use numerals with am or pm, followed by a space, followed by the time of day (am or pm). Remove the minutes from on-the-hour time.

Do

Use minutes for ranges of time.


For reference in instances where parties from other time zones will be included (like webinars, meetings, or events), indicate the time zone as noted below:

Eastern Standard Time: EST
Central Standard Time: CST
Mountain Standard Time: MST
Pacific Standard Time: PST
Greenwich Mean Time: GMT
Coordinated Universal Time: UTC
Central European Time: CET
Eastern Europe Time: EET
Western Europe Time: WET
Singapore Time: SGT
China Standard Time: CST
Emojis
While we’re a casual bunch, avoid using emojis in learning content as they can be interpreted in different ways and often come off as unprofessional.

Exceptions include the following scenarios:

When using ✅  and ❌  in tables to denote content that is supported versus unsupported, or recommended versus not recommended
When used in example copy for a campaign or Canvas message
Example Names
Never use real names, email addresses, or any other personally identifiable information (PII). Instead, use fictional examples or placeholder text.


When you need to include names in your writing, refer to Wikipedia’s list of Unisex names. Use the pronouns “they”, “their”, and “theirs” when possible, and avoid using examples that are limited to a specific gender.

Example Email Addresses
Use the format “name@example.com” for generic email addresses. Replace “name” with an example name. For example:

alex@example.com
lee@example.com
yuri@example.com
Figures and Other Images
When creating figures and images, refer to the Image Copy Style Guide. Never include personally identifiable information (PII) in figures or images.

Alt Text
Always include alt text with images. Screen readers announce alt text to explain images to people with loss of vision. As such, your alt text must convey all the key information depicted in the image.

Use the following guidelines when writing alt text:

Use plain language.
Write in complete sentences, and use sentence case.
Omit unnecessary words.
Don’t include “image of” or “picture of”. It’s already understood that you are referring to an image.
Don’t include special characters. For example, instead of ampersands (&), use the word “and” written out.

Don’t


Leave alt tags explicitly blank (alt="") if the image is adding a redundant visual component to what is explained in the text.


Adding alt text to every image does not automatically make webpage content easy to navigate and consume. Redundant visuals are powerful for sighted users because visual information is easy to understand and remember. However, alt text describing redundant images can be unnecessary for users who can’t see the image because every page element demands equal attention from screen-reader users to determine if it’s useful for their task.



Example company names
If possible, take screenshots from dashboard-06 so that you’re using one of the FakeBrandz company names.

File Types and Filenames
When you’re referring to a file type, use the standard name of the type. If the file type is an acronym, refer to the file type in all caps.


CSV

Use the standard name of the file type.


Don’t
Use the file extension.

When you’re referring to the name of a file, format the filename as code text. For more information, see the section Code in Text.

When naming files in Braze documentation, such as article or image files, use all lowercase and separate words with underscores, not hyphens. For more information, refer to Creating Files and Folders on GitHub.

Footnotes
Footnotes are annotations that provide additional information and are usually placed at the end of a page. Because of the formatting of our text, footnotes are not optimal for most use cases. The following describes when to use footnotes versus other attribution methods:


If you are presenting a list of statistics or other dense information that all need to be attributed to sources, use footnotes.
If you are presenting one or two pieces of information, use a link or an alert.
If you need to provide additional information to items in a table, use an asterisk (*) symbol next to the table item and present the information after the table.
Formatting Text in Instructions
Use consistent text formatting to help readers find and interpret information. This section provides guidelines on what formatting to use when describing or referring to different text elements in your instructions.

This section covers the following elements:

Buttons
Checkboxes
Command-line commands and options
Dialog boxes
Error messages
Filter and operator names
Folder and filenames
Key names and combinations
Metrics

Command-line commands and options
When referring to command-line commands or options, use code formatting. Match capitalization to how it appears, or how it must be typed.

Dialog boxes (Modals)
Avoid referring to dialog boxes by name unless clarity is needed. Instead, describe what the reader needs to do. If you refer to a dialog box, use bold text for the name of the dialog box and match the capitalization of the UI.

Click Upload then select a file to upload.


Click Upload and use the File Upload dialog box to select a file to upload.

For example, this is how keyboard tags appear in Braze documentation:



Metrics
When referring to a metric in a table or glossary entry, use initial caps with no special formatting. When referring to a metric in a sentence, use initial caps with italics (such as Machine Opens).

Pages
Use the term page when referring to a web page in general, or a specific page on the Braze dashboard. When referring to a page name, use the format “the [label] page” and bold the name of the page.

Go to the Segments page.


Go to the “Segments” page.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Order the FAQs by starting with the information that people most want or need to know, and then organize the FAQs by issue category if there are multiple ones.


For each FAQ, start by directly answering the question, then go into detail. Use real questions that match typical search queries and user vocabulary, which will help with FAQ findability. Include links to resources that the user may find helpful, such as related articles, instructions for contacting support, and teaching materials (how to guides, tutorials, and others) when available.

Geography
Cities
Spell out all city names on the first mention in the copy. After that, it’s fine to abbreviate well-known city names like NYC or LA.


First mention: San Francisco

Second mention: SF


For well-known cities like London or Tokyo, it’s fine to introduce them without a comma followed by the state, province, or country.


For cities or towns that may be unfamiliar to your audience, include the state, province, or country.


Biloxi, Mississippi

New Bedford, MA

Antwerp, Brussel

Do

Countries
Capitalize the names of all countries. To abbreviate a country name, spell the first mention out in full, followed by the initials moving forward.


First mention: United States

Second mention: US

                

Don’t place periods between abbreviated country names.

UK

Washington, DC

Do


U.K.

Regions
Capitalize both the region and the directional modifying it.


Example: Northern California, Eastern Europe


Capitalize proper nouns describing a specific region or place.


Example: West Midlands, South America, South Chicago

States and Provinces
Capitalize all states and provinces.


Example: New York, Quebec

Headings and Titles

For article headings and titles, use sentence case capitalization. Be descriptive when writing headings and titles, and focus on the main purpose of the content based on the article type.


For article titles, use gerunds (verbs ending in -ing) to begin the title when applicable. Keep the article titles concise and make sure it is appropriate for the content. For example, a reference article about SMS messages could be titled “About SMS”.


For article headings, be concise and consistent across heading titles. For example, if the article’s Heading 1 style defines each step (ex. Step 1: Create a new push campaign), then keep this format across the article headings for consistency.


For styling help in Braze Docs, refer to the Contributing page for Styling examples. 

Numeric subtasks
For headers that describe ordered steps, use numerals in the subtask headers.

Introductions
Introductions serve as a quick check for users asking:

Am I in the right document? Is this relevant to me?
What will I learn if I invest the time in reading this doc?
Do I feel like I am following a clear integration/setup journey for SMS/email/IAM etc. (despite not spelling out which doc a user should go to next)?
The following are general guidelines for introductions. Refer to section-specific guidelines for more niche use cases.

Introductions can be anywhere from 1-5 sentences
Introductions should give an overview of the doc's content or be an opener for the topic
Use block quotes
Place introductions under the H1 header of the article
Partners
Include an overview of the partner and a brief company description. Also, include a link to the partner site.

API
Include only the "Use this endpoint..." sentence in the intro. We want to keep the API endpoints as easy to navigate as possible.

User guide and developer guide
Intro paragraphs should be written in one of two ways:

With a lead-in paragraph or opener for the topic
A statement of what the article contains. This will often look like "This reference article....".
While the steps in the user guide and developer guide have users relying heavily on clues from the navigation throughout their customer journey, while sometimes redundant, it is helpful to explicitly say the value of the doc right at the beginning.

For example, if a user were going through the developer guide integrating unity. This page with the title “Integration” would not be enough to go on without including the intro sentence.

Lists
Lists are best used to format related information. Don't use a list to show only one item. If you want to set a single item off from surrounding text, then use some other formatting.


There are three types of lists: bulleted, lettered, and numbered. Include an introductory complete sentence that can end with a colon or period.


Bulleted lists organize information that does not need to be in a specific order.
Lettered lists are used to define mutually exclusive options.
Numbered lists indicate a sequence of ordered steps.

Use the same syntax for all list items if possible.


For list item capitalization, start each list item with a capital letter. For list item ending punctuation, do not use ending punctuation in the following scenarios:

If the list item is a single word or incomplete sentence
If the list item doesn’t include a verb
If the list item is in code font
If the list item is a link or document title
Media Formatting
This section includes general guidelines for formatting images and GIFs in your content. For more information, including example screenshots, refer to the Image Copy Style Guide.

Do

Do tightly crop to the feature or component of mention.
Do take high-quality screenshots, preferably on a retina monitor (MacBook display).
Do create a GIF of an interaction or workflow. Keep in mind that users cannot pause or scrub through a GIF to see details.  
Do run images through an optimizer to reduce file size (ImageOptim, TinyPNG, or Ezgif).
Do aim for high contrast between elements for accessibility.
Do resize images by height percentages rather than distinct pixel values.


Don’t

Don’t include the header or sidebar of the dashboard, as these can be explained in a simple sentence.
Don’t include the entire dashboard.
Don’t include Personally Identifiable Information (unless blurred, or that of a demo user).
Don’t include the browser frame (URL field, bookmarks, tabs, etc.).
Don’t include dashboards of Technology Partners.
Don’t add a border or drop shadow to images.
Numbers
Never start a sentence with a numeral. The exception is when referring to a year (example: “2019 was one for the books!).


Spell out numerals up to nine. For units of measurement or numbers 10 or higher, use the numeral. For numbers over three digits, use a comma. Write out larger numbers.

1,000

200,000

1,000,000

9 billion

5 MB

Do


1000

200000

1000000

9000000000

five MB

Don’t


Currency
Always indicate what currency you’re referring to by using the currency symbol before the amount or spell it out (example: pesos, euros, pounds, etc.).


Use the decimal for amounts where the number of cents is greater than zero.  For sums greater than three digits, use a comma. Don’t include “.00” in sums of money.

US$20

Do


$20

Don’t


Telephone Numbers
When a phone number is referenced, place hyphens between the digits. Do not place the area code within parentheses.


When formatting phone numbers with a country code, use a plus sign (+) before the country code and place the area code within parentheses.


Provide a number with a country code like so: +1 (504) 327-7269

123-456-7890

+1 (123) 456-7890

Do


(123)-456-7890

1 234-567-9012

Don’t


Fractions
Spell out fractions and use a hyphen between the numerator and the denominator. Do not use numerals separated by a slash.


In some cases when expressing a fraction as a decimal is necessary, add a zero before the decimal point for fractions less than one.  


When expressing rating systems using fractions, use numerals to spell out the ranking.

0.5

one-third

9 out of 10

Do


1/2

one third

nine out of ten

Don’t


Percentages
Use numerals and a percent sign (%) without a space in between them. However, if the percent starts the sentence, then spell out the entire percentage (number and percent).

10%

Twenty percent of Braze users are...

Do


10 %

20% of Braze users are...

Don’t


Ranges
Use a hyphen to indicate a range of numbers. Do not use an en dash to separate numbers in a range.


For ranges of numbers with units, repeat the unit of measurement after the number. This does not include repeating nouns. Use the word “to” between the numbers in the range to avoid confusion.

5 to 100

-10°C to 50°C

Do


5–100

-10°C-50°C

Don’t


Placeholder Text
Use placeholder text to signify where the reader should supply the relevant value. Placeholder text should indicate the content that’s being represented. For example YOUR_API_KEY indicates the reader’s API key.

Writing Placeholders
When creating placeholder text, refer to the following guidelines:

Guideline

Example

Use uppercase letters and separate words with underscores (_).

PLACEHOLDER_VARIABLE

​​For inline placeholder text, use italics.

PLACEHOLDER_VARIABLE

For API code block placeholder text (where you can’t use italics), enclose the placeholders in curly brackets ({}).

<string name="com_appboy_api_key">{YOUR_APP_IDENTIFIER_API_KEY}</string>

For Liquid code block placeholder text (where you can’t use italics), use uppercase letters.

{%- connected_content YOUR-API-URL :save items -%}


Don’t sacrifice clarity for brevity. Use as many words as needed to represent a placeholder.

Do: CAMPAIGN_NAME

Don’t: NAME

Using Placeholders
When introducing or explaining a placeholder, refer to the following guidelines:

Guideline

Example

Call out placeholders immediately after the placeholder.

Replace <YOUR_APP_IDENTIFIER_API_KEY> with your App Identifier API Key, which you can find on the Settings page.

To call out two or more placeholders at once, use a bulleted list. List each placeholder in the order they appear in the code.

Replace the following:

PLACEHOLDER_VARIABLE: a description of what the placeholder represents
PLACEHOLDER_VARIABLE: a description of what the placeholder represents
Refer to the placeholder in the same formatting that it’s shown in the text or code.

target '<YOUR_APP_TARGET>' do

  pod 'Appboy-iOS-SDK'

end

Replace <YOUR_APP_TARGET> with the name of your target app.

Products
When referring to Braze and its features, use full product and feature names, and capitalize them according to the UI. Don’t capitalize templates or common features. For a list of product names and their spelling, refer to the Glossary.

Don’t abbreviate product or feature names except in the following cases:

To match the UI
To meet limited space constraints
Never use product or feature names as verbs.

Never use an apostrophe after Braze (example:“Braze’s.”) It sounds awkward. Instead, form possessives using a preposition (“to, of, from”) followed by the company name.


The newest product update from Braze
That’s one of the defining features of Braze.

Do


Braze’s newest product update
That’s one of Braze’s defining features

Don’t


Refer to “Braze” as “we/our/ours.” Never “it/its/they/their.”

Tables
Using tables can be a helpful and organized way to display information. Make sure to have clear, descriptive headers and relevant data within the respective columns and rows.


Always use an introductory sentence to describe the purpose of the table. Avoid using tables in the middle of numbered procedures. Instead, consider using a list.

Units of Measurement
For HTML and Markdown, use a nonbreaking space (&nbsp) between the number and the unit when specifying a unit of measurement. This includes most units of measurement such as distance, pixels, points, weight, and degrees of temperature (between the degree and unit of measurement).


For currency, percent, or degrees of an angle, don’t use a space between the number and unit.


For ranges of numbers with units, repeat the unit for each number. Similarly, for rates, use “per” instead of a slash (/).

LINKING
Cross-reference Links
Use cross-references to guide users to additional resources. In Braze documentation, use site-root-relative URLs to link to other Braze docs (replace “www.braze.com/docs” with “{{site.baseurl}}”).


Avoid adding multiple links to the same document within a given page, as this can cause link fatigue. Duplicate links are fine in moderation if you’re linking to a specific section on another page, or if the page you’re linking from is long.

Embedding Videos
Similar to images, use videos to create variety in your learning materials. Most people learn best with a combination of mediums, so make sure that any content you include in a video is also covered in the article or lesson.


To embed a video in Braze documentation, refer to Embedded Video Test.

Headings as Link Targets
In Braze documentation, anchors are automatically created for headings. However, you may want to add a custom anchor to a heading if:

Your auto-generated anchor will be very long.
Your heading may be frequently linked to. Adding a custom anchor reduces the likelihood of breaking links if the heading text is changed later.

To add an anchor to a heading in Braze documentation, refer to Custom Anchors.

Link Text
Effective link text helps to improve the findability, discoverability, and accessibility of your content.

Structuring Links
Use one of the following formats when writing links:

Match the link text to the title or heading of the link destination.
Use a description of the link destination as the link text.

Get started with the Braze Web SDK.

For more information, see Aborting Liquid Messages.


Do

Match the link text to the title or heading of the link destination.


To find out your specific cluster or endpoint, contact Support.

When in doubt, you can always reset your password.


Do

Use a description of the link destination as the link text.

You may need to rephrase a sentence to make good link text.

If you’re linking to a section on the same page, use a standard phrase that indicates this action. For example:

On this page, see [heading].
In this document, refer to [heading].
For more information, refer to the section [heading].
Writing Links
Apply the following guidelines when writing link text:

Put the link in the relevant key words.
If you are writing a complete sentence that refers the reader to another article, use the phrase “For more information, see” or “For more information about [topic], see”.
Only add a "Learn more…" sentence is the help text addresses more than one concept, each of which could be linked to their own help doc. In this situation, pick the most appropriate link and contextualize it with "Learn more…"
To keep an informal tone, don’t use “please” to introduce link text. For example, avoid the phrase “Please refer to”, “Please see”, and “Please contact”.
Write unique, descriptive link text that makes sense without the surrounding text. Research by the Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g) shows that readers scan for salient information on a page, so make sure links can stand alone.
Don’t use the following words or phrases for link text. They’re bad for accessibility and scannability.

Links for Endpoints
When referencing endpoint articles, be sure to use meaningful link text that can make sense out of context. If you’re using the endpoint’s path as a link, be sure to provide details in the surrounding text as the path may not clearly communicate the endpoint’s function.

Don’t


Links to Other Sites
As a general rule, don’t link to another site if you can cover the information with a brief explanation. We can’t keep track of when the content on another site changes.

If you do link to an external site, make sure that the site you link to is high quality, reliable, and respectable. If possible, link to the most relevant heading on a page.


Use an external link icon to indicate that the link goes to a different domain. For Braze documentation, this is automatically applied to external links.

URLs for Images
In Braze documentation, use site-root-relative URLs to link to images. For more information, refer to Adding and Editing Images.
