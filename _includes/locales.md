| A translation file is missing locales associated with the current message.                                                                               | This translation file won't be uploaded.                                                                       |
| A translation file is missing text blocks, such as a text within Liquid translation tags, from the current email message.                                | This translation file won't be uploaded.                                                                       |
| The translation file includes the default text that doesn't match the text blocks in the current email message.                                          | This translation file won't be uploaded. Fix this in your CSV before attempting to upload again.               |
| The translation file includes locales that don't exist in **Multi-Language Support** settings.                                                           | These locales will not be saved in Braze.                                                                      |
| The translation file includes text blocks that don't exist in the current message (such as the current draft at the time the translations are uploaded). | The text blocks that don't exist in your current message will not be saved from the translation file to Braze. |
| Removing a locale from the message after that locale has already been uploaded to the message as part of the translation file.                           | Removing the locale will remove any translations associated with the locale in your message.                   |
