Installing the Braze SDK will provide you with basic analytics functionality{% if include.platform == 'iOS' %} as well as a working in-app messages with which you can engage your users{% endif %}.

The {{include.platform}} Braze SDK should be installed or updated using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/), a dependency manager for Objective-C and Swift projects. CocoaPods provides added simplicity for integration and updating.

## {{include.platform}} SDK CocoaPods integration

### Step 1: Install CocoaPods

Installing the SDK via the {{include.platform}} [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) automates the majority of the installation process for you. Before beginning this process, check that you are using [Ruby version 2.0.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/) or greater. Note that knowledge of Ruby syntax isn't necessary to install this SDK.

Simply run the following command to get started:

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

**Note**: If you are prompted to overwrite the `rake` executable please refer to the [Getting Started Directions on CocoaPods.org](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) for further details.

**Note**: If you have issues regarding CocoaPods, please refer to the [CocoaPods Troubleshooting Guide](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/troubleshooting.html).

### Step 2: Constructing the podfile

Now that you've installed the CocoaPods Ruby Gem, you're going to need to create a file in your Xcode project directory named `Podfile`.

Add the following line to your podfile:

```
target 'YourAppTarget' do
  pod 'Appboy-{{include.platform}}-SDK'
end
```

**Note**: We suggest you version Braze so pod updates automatically grab anything smaller than a minor version update. This looks like 'pod 'Appboy-{{include.platform}}-SDK' ~> Major.Minor.Build'. If you want to integrate the latest version of Braze SDK automatically even with major changes, you can use `pod 'Appboy-{{include.platform}}-SDK'` in your podfile.
{% if include.platform == 'iOS' %}
**Note**: If you do not use any Braze default UI and don't want to introduce the SDWebImage dependency, please point your Braze dependency in your Podfile to our Core subspec, like `pod 'Appboy-iOS-SDK/Core'` in your Podfile. {% endif %}.

### Step 3: Installing the Braze SDK

To install the Braze SDK CocoaPods, navigate to the directory of your Xcode app project within your terminal and run the following command:
```
pod install
```

At this point you should be able to open the new Xcode project workspace created by CocoaPods. Make sure to use this Xcode workspace instead of your Xcode project. 

![New Workspace]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/podsworkspace.png %})

### Step 4: Updating your app delegate

{% tabs %}
{% tab OBJECTIVE-C %}

Add the following line of code to your `AppDelegate.m` file:

```objc
{% if include.platform == 'iOS' %}#import "Appboy-iOS-SDK/AppboyKit.h"{% else %}#import <AppboyTVOSKit/AppboyKit.h>{% endif %}
```

Within your `AppDelegate.m` file, add the following snippet within your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

```objc
[Appboy startWithApiKey:@"YOUR-API-KEY"
         inApplication:application
     withLaunchOptions:launchOptions];
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab swift %}

If you are integrating the Braze SDK with CocoaPods or Carthage, add the following line of code to your `AppDelegate.swift` file:

```swift
{% if include.platform == 'iOS' %}import Appboy_iOS_SDK{% else %}import AppboyTVOSKit{% endif %}
```

For more information about using Objective-C code in Swift projects, please see the [Apple Developer Docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/buildingcocoaapps/MixandMatch.html).

In `AppDelegate.swift`, add following snippet to your `application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool`:

```swift
Appboy.start(withApiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY", in:application, withLaunchOptions:launchOptions)
```

**Note**: The Braze `sharedInstance` singleton will be nil before `startWithApiKey:` is called, as that is a prerequisite to using any Braze functionality.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% alert important %}
Be sure to update `YOUR-API-KEY` with the correct value from your Manage Settings page.
{% endalert %}

{% alert warning %}
Be sure to initialize Braze in your application's main thread. Initializing asynchronously can lead to broken functionality.
{% endalert %}


### Step 5: Specify your custom endpoint or data cluster

{% alert note %}
Note that as of December 2019, custom endpoints are no longer given out, if you have a pre-existing custom endpoint, you may continue to use it. For more details, refer to our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/basics/#endpoints">list of available endpoints</a>.
{% endalert %}

Your Braze representative should have already advised you of the [correct endpoint]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/sdk_endpoints/).

#### Compile-time endpoint configuration (recommended)
If given a pre-existing custom endpoint...
- Starting with Braze iOS SDK v3.0.2, you can set a custom endpoint using the `Info.plist` file. Add the `Appboy` dictionary to your Info.plist file. Inside the `Appboy` dictionary, add the `Endpoint` string subentry and set the value to your custom endpoint url’s authority (for example, `sdk.iad-01.braze.com`, not `https://sdk.iad-01.braze.com`).

#### Runtime endpoint configuration

If given a pre-existing custom endpoint...
- Starting with Braze iOS SDK v3.17.0+, you can override set your endpoint via the `ABKEndpointKey` inside the `appboyOptions` parameter passed to `startWithApiKey:inApplication:withLaunchOptions:withAppboyOptions:`. Set the value to your custom endpoint url’s authority (for example, `sdk.iad-01.braze.com`, not `https://sdk.iad-01.braze.com`).

{% alert note %}
Support for setting endpoints at runtime using `ABKAppboyEndpointDelegate` has been removed in Braze iOS SDK v3.17.0. If you already use `ABKAppboyEndpointDelegate`, note that in Braze iOS SDK versions v3.14.1 to v3.16.0, any reference to `dev.appboy.com` in your `getApiEndpoint()` method must be replaced with a reference to `sdk.iad-01.braze.com`.
{% endalert %}

{% alert important %}
To find out your specific cluster, please ask your Customer Success Manager or reach out to our support team.
{% endalert %}

### SDK integration complete

Braze should now be collecting data from your application and your basic integration should be complete. {% if include.platform == 'iOS' %}Please see the following sections in order to enable custom event tracking, push messaging, the news-feed and the complete suite of Braze features.{% else %}Please note that when compiling your tvOS app and any other third-party libraries, Bitcode must be enabled.{% endif %}

### Updating the Braze SDK via CocoaPods

To update a Cocoapod simply run the following commands within your project directory:

```
pod update
```

## Customizing Braze on startup

If you wish to customize Braze on startup, you can instead use the Braze initialization method `startWithApiKey:inApplication:withLaunchOptions:withAppboyOptions` and pass in an optional `NSDictionary` of Braze startup keys.
{% tabs %}
{% tab OBJECTIVE-C %}

In your `AppDelegate.m` file, within your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method, add the following Braze method:

```objc
[Appboy startWithApiKey:@"YOUR-API-KEY"
          inApplication:application
      withLaunchOptions:launchOptions
      withAppboyOptions:appboyOptions];
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab swift %}

In `AppDelegate.swift`, within your `application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool` method, add the following Braze method:

```swift
Appboy.start(withApiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY",
                 in:application,
                 withLaunchOptions:launchOptions,
                 withAppboyOptions:appboyOptions)
```

where `appboyOptions` is a `Dictionary` of startup configuration values.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Note**: This method would replace the `startWithApiKey:inApplication:withLaunchOptions:` initialization method.

This method is called with the following parameters:

- `YOUR-API-KEY` – Your application's API Key from the Braze dashboard
- `application` – The current app
- `launchOptions` – The options `NSDictionary` that you get from `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`
- `appboyOptions` – An optional `NSDictionary` with startup configuration values for Braze

See [Appboy.h](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/blob/master/AppboyKit/include/Appboy.h) for a list of Braze startup keys.

## Appboy.sharedInstance() and Swift nullability
Differing somewhat from common practice, the `Appboy.sharedInstance()` singleton is optional. This is because `sharedInstance` is `nil` before `startWithApiKey:` is called, and there are some non-standard but not-invalid implementations in which a delayed initialization can be used.

If you call `startWithApiKey:` in your `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` delegate before any access to Appboy's `sharedInstance` (the standard implementation), you can use optional chaining, like `Appboy.sharedInstance()?.changeUser("testUser")`, to avoid cumbersome checks. This will have parity with an Objective-C implementation that assumed a non-null `sharedInstance`.
