### Automatic Preservation of Anonymous User History

| Identification Context | Preservation Behavior |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| User __has not__ been previously identified | Anonymous history __is merged__ with user profile upon identification |
| User __has been__ previously identified in-app or via API | Anonymous history __is not merged__ with user profile upon identification |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

### Additional Notes and Best Practices
Please note the following:

- __If your app is used by multiple people, you can assign each user a unique identifier to track them.__
- __Once a user ID has been set, you cannot revert that user to an anonymous profile__
- __Do Not change the user ID upon a user "log out".__
  - Doing so separates the device from the user profile. You will be unable to target the previously logged out user with re-engagement messages. If you anticipate multiple users on the same device, but only want to target one of them when your app is in a logged-out state, we recommend separately keeping track of the user ID you want to target while logged out and switching back to that user ID as part of your app's logout process. By default, only the last user that was logged in will receive push notifications from your app.
- __Switching from one identified user to another is a relatively costly operation.__
  - When you request the user switch, the current session for the previous user is automatically closed and a new session is started. Furthermore, Braze will automatically make a data refresh request for the News Feed, in-app messages, and other Braze resources for the new user.

If you opt to use a hash of a unique identifier as your user ID take care to ensure that you're normalizing the input to your hashing function. For example, if you're going to use a hash of an email address, ensure that you're stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, and taking localization into account.
