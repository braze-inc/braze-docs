User IDs should be set for each of your users. These should be unchanging and accessible when a user opens the app. Naming your User IDs correctly from the start is one of the most **crucial** steps when setting up User IDs. We strongly suggest using the Braze standard of UUIDs/GUIDs (detailed below). We also, strongly recommend providing this identifier as it will allow you to:

- Track your users across devices and platforms, improving the quality of your behavioral and demographic data.
- Import data about your users using our [user data API][1].
- Target specific users with our [messaging API][2] for both general and transactional messages.

{% alert note %}
If such an identifier is not available, Braze will assign a unique identifier to your users, but you will lack the capabilities listed for user IDs. You should avoid setting User IDs for users for whom you lack a unique identifier that is tied to them as an individual. Passing a device identifier offers no benefit versus the automatic anonymous user tracking Braze offers by default.
{% endalert %}

{% alert warning %}
These User IDs should be private and not easily obtained (e.g., not a plain email address or username).

For additional security, we recommend adding our [SDK authentication](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_wide/sdk_authentication/) feature to prevent user impersonation.
