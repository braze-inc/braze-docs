When you [create placements in your app or website]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/banners/placements/#requestBannersRefresh), your app sends a request to Braze to fetch Banner messages for each placement.  

- You can request up to **10 placements per refresh request** by default. If more than 10 placements are requested, only the first 10 are returned; the rest are dropped.  
- For each placement, Braze returns the **highest-priority Banner** the user is eligible to receive.

Refresh limits depend on the SDK version your app is using:
- For SDK versions Android 38.0.0, Swift 13.1.0 and Web 6.1.0, placements refreshes use a token bucket algorithm. This allows multiple refreshes in a session within the defined limits (a bucket size of 5 requests with a refill rate of one per 180 seconds).
- For older SDK versions, placement refreshes are limited to once per session. Additional refresh calls in the same session are ignored.

Check which SDK version your app is running to ensure you understand the applicable refresh limits.
