Keep in mind, your preview may not be identical to the final render on a user's device due to differences across hardware.

To send a test message, add either a content test group or one or more individual users as **Test Recipients**, then select **Send Test**. You'll be able to view your test message on the device for up to 5 minutes.

While reviewing your test Banner, verify the following:

- Is your Banner campaign assigned to a placement?
- Do the images and media show up and act as expected on your targeted device types and screen sizes?
- Do your links and buttons direct the user to where they should go?
- Does the Liquid function as expected? Have you accounted for a default attribute value in the event that the Liquid returns no information?
- Is your copy clear, concise, and correct?
