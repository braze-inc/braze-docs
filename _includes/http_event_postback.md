All transactional emails are complemented with event status postbacks sent as an HTTP request back to your specified URL. This will allow you to evaluate the message status in real-time and take action to reach the user on another channel if the message goes undelivered, or fallback to an internal system if Braze is experiencing latency.

You can associate these updates with individual messages using unique identifiers:

- `dispatch_id`: A unique ID Braze automatically generates for each message.
- `external_send_id`: A custom identifier you provide, such as an order number, to match updates with your internal systems.

For example, If you include `external_send_id: 1234` in the request when sending an order confirmation email, all subsequent event postbacks for that email—like `Sent` or `Delivered`—will include `external_send_id: 1234`. This allows you to confirm whether the customer for order #1234 received their order confirmation email.

### Setting up postbacks

In your Braze dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Email Preferences**.
2. Under **Transactional Event Status Postback**, enter the URL where Braze should send status updates for your transactional emails.
3. Test the postback.
