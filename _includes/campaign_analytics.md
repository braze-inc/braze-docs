From the **Campaign Analytics** tab, you can view your reports in a series of panels. You may see more or less than those listed in the sections below, but each has its own useful purpose.

### Campaign Details

The **Campaign Details** panel shows a high-level overview of the entire performance for your 
  {% if include.channel == "Content Card" %}Content Card.
  {% elsif include.channel == "email" %}email.
  {% elsif include.channel == "in-app message" %}in-app message.
  {% elsif include.channel == "push" %}push message.
  {% elsif include.channel == "SMS" %}SMS.
  {% elsif include.channel == "whatsapp" %}WhatApp messages.
  {% elsif include.channel == "webhook" %}webhook.
  {% endif %}

Review this panel to see overall metrics such as the number of messages sent to the number of recipients, the primary conversion rate, and the total revenue generated by this message. You can also review delivery, audience, and conversion settings from this page.

{% if include.channel == "whatsapp" %}
{% alert note %}
The WhatsApp channel includes read rate. This metric is only delivered for users with read receipts on, which can vary.

{% alert note %}
Regarding how impressions are logged, there are some nuances between web, Android, and iOS. Generally speaking, Braze logs an impression when a card is seen, which is after a user scrolls to the specific Content Card in their feed.
{% endalert %}

#### Unique Recipients versus Unique Impressions

There are a few metrics available that cover the visibility of your message. This includes _Messages Sent_, _Unique Recipients_, and _Unique Impressions_. In particular, the difference between _Unique Recipients_ and _Unique Impressions_ can be a bit confusing. Let's use a few example scenarios to understand these metrics better.

Let's say you view a Content Card today, then view the same card tomorrow, and again the day after tomorrow—you will be counted as a _Unique Recipient_ three times. However, you will only be counted for one _Unique Impression_. You'll also be included in the number of _Messages Sent_, as the card was available on your device.

As another example, suppose you see five _Unique Impressions_ on a Content Card campaign showing 150,000 _Messages Sent_. This means the card was made available (on the backend) to an audience of 150,000 users, but only five users' devices performed all of the following steps after that send occurred:

1. Started a session or the app explicitly requested a Content Cards sync (or both)
2. Navigated to the Content Cards view
3. SDK recorded an impression and logged it to the server

Your _Messages Sent_ refers to Content Cards available to be seen, while _Unique Recipients_ refers to Content Cards that were actually seen.

##### Estimated real open rate {#estimated-real-open-rate}

This statistic uses a proprietary analytical model created by Braze to reconstruct an estimate of the campaign's unique open rate as if machine opens did not exist. While we receive labels of *Machine Opens* on some open events from email senders (see above), these labels can often label actual opens as real opens. In other words, the *Other Opens* are likely an underestimate of real opens (by actual users). Instead, Braze uses click data from each campaign to infer the rate at which actual humans opened the message. This compensates for various machine opening mechanisms, including Apple’s MPP.

_Estimated Real Open Rate_ is calculated 36 hours after email sending has begun and is recalculated every 24 hours thereafter. If a campaign recurs, the estimate is recalculated 36 hours after another send occurs.

Typically around 10,000 delivered emails are required for the statistic to be computed successfully, though that number can vary depending on click rate. If the statistic can't be computed, then the column displays "--".

###### Limitations

Estimated Real Open Rate is only available in campaigns, and is not reported in Current events. This metric is only retroactively calculated for active campaigns launched before November 14, 2023.

> Delivery of notifications is a “best effort” by Apple Push Notification services (APNs). It is not intended to deliver data to your app, only to notify the user that there is new data available. The important distinction is that we will display how many messages we successfully delivered to APNs, not necessarily how many APNs successfully delivered to devices.

##### Tracking unsubscribes

Push unsubscribes are not included as a metric in campaign analytics. Refer to [Tracking push unsubscribes]({{site.baseurl}}/help/help_articles/push/push_unsubscribes) for steps on how to manually track this metric.

##### Understanding opens

Even though _Direct Opens_ and _Influenced Opens_ include the word "opens", they're actually different metrics. _Direct Opens_ refers to the direct opening of a push notification, as stated in the table above. _Influenced Opens_ refers to the opening of an app, without opening a push notification within a specific time frame after receiving it. So, _Influenced Opens_ refers to the app opens, not push notification opens.

##### Why push sends can exceed unique recipients

The number of _Sends_ may exceed the number of _Unique Recipients_ due to the following reasons:

- **Re-eligibility is on:** When re-eligibility is enabled in your campaign or Canvas settings, users who meet the segment and delivery criteria can receive the same push notification multiple times. This results in a higher number of total sends.
- **Users have multiple devices:** If re-eligibility is not enabled, the difference may be explained by users having multiple devices associated with their profile. For instance, a user could have both a smartphone and tablet, and the push notification is being sent to all registered devices. Each delivery counts as a send, but only one unique recipient is recorded.
- **Users are assigned to multiple apps:** If users are associated with more than one app (such as when testing a new app), they may receive the same push notification on each app. This contributes to a higher number of sends.

##### Why bounces occur {#bounced-push}

{% tabs %}
{% tab Apple Push Notification service %}

Bounces occur in Apple Push Notification services (APNs) when a push notification attempts delivery to a device that does not have the intended app installed. APNs also has the right to change tokens for devices arbitrarily. If you attempt to send to a user’s device in which their push token has changed in between when we previously registered their token (such as at the beginning of each session when we register a user for a push token) and the time of send, this would cause a bounce.

If a user disables push within their device settings on subsequent app open the SDK will detect that push has been disabled and notify Braze. At this point we will update the push enabled state to be disabled. When a disabled user receives a push campaign before having a new session, the campaign would successfully send and appear as delivered. The push will not bounce for this user. Following a subsequent session, when you attempt to send a push to the user Braze is already aware of whether we have a foreground token as such no notification is sent.

Push notifications that expire before delivery are not considered as failed and will not be recorded as a bounce.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Firebase Cloud Messaging %}

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) bounces could occur in three cases:

| Scenario | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Uninstalled applications | When a message attempts delivery to a device and the intended app is uninstalled on that device, the message will be discarded and the device's registration ID will be invalidated. Any future attempts at messaging the device will return a NotRegistered error. |
| Backed up application | When an application is backed up, its registration ID could become invalid before the application is restored. In this case, FCM will no longer store the application's registration ID and the application will no longer receive messages. As such, registration IDs should **not** be saved when an application is backed up. |
| Updated application | When an application is updated, the previous version's registration ID may no longer work. As such, an updated application should replace its existing registration ID. |

## Retention report

Retention reports show you the rates at which your users have performed a selected retention event over time periods in a specific campaign or Canvas. For more information, refer to [Retention reports]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/reporting/retention_reports/).

## Funnel report

Funnel reporting offers a visual report that allows you to analyze the journeys your customers take after receiving a campaign or Canvas. If your campaign or Canvas uses a control group or multiple variants, you will be able to understand how the different variants have impacted the conversion funnel at a more granular level and optimize based on this data.
