## Campaign Analytics

Once you've launched your campaign, you can return to the details page for that campaign to view key metrics. Navigate to the **Campaigns** page and select your campaign to open the details page. For {% if include.channel == "Content Card" %}Content Cards{% elsif include.channel == "email" %}email{% elsif include.channel == "in-app message" %}in-app messages{% elsif include.channel == "push" %}push messages{% elsif include.channel == "SMS" %}SMS messages{% endif %} sent in Canvas, refer to [Canvas Analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/get_started/measuring_and_testing_with_canvas_analytics/).

{% alert tip %}
Looking for definitions for the terms and metrics listed in your report? Refer to our {% if include.channel == "email" %}[Email Analytics Glossary]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/reporting_and_analytics/analytics_glossary/){% elsif include.channel == "Content Card" %}[Report Metrics Glossary]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/report_metrics/) and filter by Content Cards{% elsif include.channel == "in-app message" %}[Report Metrics Glossary]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/report_metrics/) and filter by In-App Message{% elsif include.channel == "push" %}[Report Metrics Glossary]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/report_metrics/) and filter by Push{% elsif include.channel == "SMS" %}[Report Metrics Glossary]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/report_metrics/) and filter by SMS{% endif %}.
{% endalert %}

From the **Campaign Analytics** tab, you can view your reports in a series of panels. You may see more or less than those listed in the sections below, but each has its own useful purpose.

### Campaign Details

The **Campaign Details** panel shows a high-level overview of the entire performance for your {% if include.channel == "Content Card" %}Content Card.{% elsif include.channel == "email" %}email.{% elsif include.channel == "in-app message" %}in-app message.{% elsif include.channel == "push" %}push message.{% elsif include.channel == "SMS" %}SMS.{% endif %}

Review this panel to see overall metrics such as how many messages have been sent to how many recipients, the primary conversion rate, and the total revenue generated by this message. You can also review your general settings from this page: Delivery Settings, Audience Settings, and Conversion Settings.

![CC_Campaign_Details]({% image_buster /assets/img/cc-campaign-details.png %})

{% if include.channel == "in-app message" %}

In Canvas, you'll see in-app message performance mapped onto the Canvas you've created. You can use the control panel at the top of the page to clear other messaging types (channels) and only view the in-app messages in your Canvas.

![In-App_Message_Canvas_Reporting]({% image_buster /assets/img/in-app_message_canvas_reporting.png %})

{% endif %}

{% if include.channel == "Content Card" %}

#### Control groups {#cc-control-group}

To measure the impact of an individual Content Card, you can add a [Control Group][2] to an A/B Test. The top-level **Campaign Details** panel doesn't include metrics from the Control Group variant.

{% alert warning %}
If you have a customized feed, be sure to log impressions for control cards to inform our analytics of when a user _would have seen_ the control card in its feed position. For more detail, see the [iOS]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/content_cards/data_model/#card-methods), [Android]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/content_cards/customization/#fully-custom-content-card-display-for-android), and [Web]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/content_cards/integration/#control-group) developer guides.
{% endalert %}

{% elsif include.channel == "SMS" %}

#### Control groups {#sms-control-group}

To measure the impact of an individual SMS message, you can add a [Control Group][2] to an A/B Test. The top-level **Campaign Details** panel doesn't include metrics from the Control Group variant.

{% endif %}

### Message Performance

The **Message Performance** panel outlines how well your message has performed across various dimensions. The metrics in this panel vary depending on your chosen messaging channel, and whether or not you are running a multivariate test. You can click on the <i class="fa fa-eye preview-icon"></i> **Preview** icon to view your message for each variant or channel.

![CC_Message_Performance]({% image_buster /assets/img/cc-message-performance.png %})

If you want to simplify your view, click <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> **Add/Remove Columns** and clear any metrics as desired. By default, all metrics are displayed.

{% if include.channel == "email" %}

#### Heat maps

Additionally, you can see how successful different links in a single email campaign are using heat maps. Expand the **Total Clicks** dropdown and click **View Heat Map** to bring up a visual view of your email that shows the overall frequency and location of clicks within the lifespan of the campaign. Note that date ranges are not taken into consideration for email heat maps.

![email_analytics]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/email_click_results_heatmap.gif %})

{% endif %}

{% if include.channel == "Content Card" %}

#### Content Card metrics

Here is a breakdown of some key metrics you may see while reviewing your message performance. For the definitions of all Content Cards metrics, refer to the [Report Metrics Glossary][1] and filter by Content Cards.

| Term | Definition |
| -- | -- |
| Total Impressions | The total count of impressions logged for a given Content Card. This can increment multiple times for the same user. |
| Unique Impressions | The number of users who have viewed a given card. This count doesn't increment the second time that a user views a card. |
| Unique Recipients | The total number of viewers (unique, but only unique per day) that have viewed the particular card. Because a viewer can be a unique recippient every day, you should expect this to be higher than Unique Impressions. |
| Unique Clicks | The number of recipients who have clicked the CTA link of a Content Card at least once—excluding clicks on Braze-provided unsubscribe links. |
Unique Dismissals | The number of users who have dismissed Content Cards from a campaign. A user dismissing a Content Card from a campaign multiple times represents one unique dismissal. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

{% alert note %}
Regarding how impressions are logged, there are some nuances between web, Android, and iOS. Generally speaking, Braze logs an impression once a card is seen—when a user scrolls to the specific Content Card in their feed.
{% endalert %}

{% details More on Unique Recipients versus Unique Impressions %}

There are a few metrics available that cover the visibility of your message. This includes Messages Sent, Unique Recipients, and Unique Impressions. In particular, the difference between Unique Recipients and Unique Impressions can be a bit confusing. Let's use a few example scenarios to understand these metrics better.

Let's say you view a Content Card today, then view the same card tomorrow, and again the day after tomorrow—you will be counted as a Unique Recipient three times. However, you will only be counted for one Unique Impression. You'll also be included in the number of Messages Sent, as the card was available on your device.

As another example, suppose you see five Unique Impressions on a Content Card campaign showing 150,000 Messages Sent. This means the card was made available (on the backend) to an audience of 150,000 users, but only five users' devices performed all of the following steps after that send occurred:

1. Started a session or the app explicitly requested a Content Cards sync (or both)
2. Navigated to the Content Cards view
3. SDK recorded an impression and logged it to the server

Your Messages Sent refers to Content Cards available to be seen, while Unique Recipients refers to Content Cards that were actually seen.

{% enddetails %}

{% elsif include.channel == "email" %}

#### Email metrics

Here are some key email-specific metrics that you won't see in other channels. To see the definitions of all email metrics used in Braze, refer to our [Email Analytics Glossary]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/reporting_and_analytics/analytics_glossary/).

| Term | Definition |
| -- | -- |
| Spam | The percentage of users that marked your email as spam, or the email was designated as spam. If this metric is above 0.08, that could be a sign that either your message copy is too salesy or you should reconsider your email address collection methods (to ensure you're messaging those that are interested in your correspondence).
| Unique opens | The percentage of recipients that opened your email. This number should be between 10–20%. Anything above 20% is exceptional!
| Unique clicks | The percentage of recipients that clicked within the email sent. This number should be between 5–10%. Anything above 10% is exceptional!
| Machine opens | Includes emails that are opened without user engagement by Apple devices with enabled [Mail Privacy Protection]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/mpp/). <br> This metric is tracked starting November 11, 2021 for Sendgrid and December 2, 2021 for Sparkpost. 
| Other opens | Includes emails that haven't been identified as "Machine Opens" such as when a user opens an email.  
| Unsubs | The percentage of recipients that clicked the "Unsubscribe" link in your email.
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

{% elsif include.channel == "in-app message" %}

#### In-app message metrics

Here are some key in-app message metrics you may see in your analytics. To see the definitions of all in-app message metrics used in Braze, refer to our [Report Metrics Glossary][1].

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Body clicks | Occurs when a user clicks on the message itself, and not one of the buttons.
| Button 1 and Button 2 clicks | The percentage of recipients that pressed that specific button. 
| Unique impressions | The total number of people who actually received and viewed the in-app message. If a user receives the message twice, they are only counted as one user.
| Impressions | The number of users whose devices reported that the message has been delivered. If a user receives the message twice, they are counted twice.

{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

{% elsif include.channel == "push" %}

#### Push metrics

Here is a breakdown of some key metrics you may see while reviewing your message performance. For the definitions of all push metrics, refer to the [Report Metrics Glossary][1] and filter by push.

| Term | Description |
| --------- | --- |
| Bounces | The push notifications sent to these users were undeliverable. These users have been automatically unsubscribed from all future push notifications. See [Bounced Push Notifications](#bounced-push). |
| Direct Opens | Instances in which a user opened your app by interacting directly with a push notification. |
| Opens | Instances including both Direct Opens (defined above) and Influenced Opens in which the Braze SDK has determined, using a proprietary algorithm, that a push notification has caused a user to open the app. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

> Delivery of notifications is a “best effort” by APNs. It is not intended to deliver data to your app, only to notify the user that there is new data available. The important distinction is that we will display how many messages we successfully delivered to APNs, not necessarily how many APNs successfully delivered to devices.

#### Bounced push notifications {#bounced-push}

##### Apple push notification service

Bounces occur in the APNs when a push notification attempts delivery to a device that does not have the intended app installed. APNs also has the right to change tokens for devices arbitrarily. If you attempt to send to a user’s device in which their push token has changed in between when we previously registered their token (i.e. at the beginning of each session when we register a user for a push token) and the time of send, this would cause a bounce.

If a user disables push within their device settings on subsequent app open the SDK will detect that push has been disabled and notify Braze. At this point we will update the push enabled state to be disabled. When a disabled user receives a push campaign before having a new session, the campaign would successfully send and appear as delivered. The push will not bounce for this user. Following a subsequent session, when you attempt to send a push to the user Braze is already aware of whether we have a token as such no notification is sent.

Push notifications that expire before delivery are not considered as failed and will not be recorded as a bounce.

##### Firebase Cloud Messaging

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) bounces could occur in three cases:

| Scenario | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Uninstalled applications | When a message attempts delivery to a device and the intended app is uninstalled on that device, the message will be discarded and the device's registration ID will be invalidated. Any future attempts at messaging the device will return a NotRegistered error. |
| Backed up application | When an application is backed up, its registration ID could become invalid before the application is restored. In this case, FCM will no longer store the application's registration ID and the application will no longer receive messages. As such, registration IDs should _not_ be saved when an application is backed up. |
| Updated application | When an application is updated, the previous version's registration ID may no longer work. As such, an updated application should replace its existing registration ID. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

{% elsif include.channel == "SMS" %}

#### SMS metrics

Here is a breakdown of some key metrics you may see while reviewing your message performance. For the definitions of all SMS metrics, refer to the [Report Metrics Glossary][1] and filter by SMS.

| Term | Definition |
| -- | -- |
| Sent | A campaign or Canvas step has been launched or triggered, and an SMS has been sent from Braze. It is possible that the SMS does not reach a user's device due to errors, as explained below.
| Sent to Carrier | Braze has attempted to send the SMS through to the carriers. This stat is the sum of Confirmed Deliveries, Rejections, and sends where the carrier did not confirm delivery or rejection. There are instances where carriers do not provide delivery or rejected confirmation, as some carriers do not provide this confirmation or were unable to do so at the time of sending.
| Delivery Failures | Messages that were not attempted to be sent due to a failed outcome within Twilio logs. This could be due to queue overflow or invalid recipient number, depending on the associated Twilio error code. Please reach out to Braze [support]({{site.baseurl}}/braze_support/) for assistance in understanding the reasons for delivery failures.
| Confirmed Delivery | The carrier has confirmed that the SMS was delivered to the target phone number. As a Braze customer, deliveries are charged toward your SMS allotment.
| Rejections | The SMS has been rejected by the carrier. This can happen for several reasons, including carrier content filtering, availability of the destination device, the phone number is no longer in service, etc. As a Braze customer, rejections are charged toward your SMS allotment.
| Opt-Out | A user replied to your message with an [Opt-Out Keyword]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/keywords/keyword_handling/#default-opt-in-opt-out-keywords) and was unsubscribed from your SMS program. A user reply is measured anytime a user sends an inbound message within four hours of receiving your message.
| Help | A user replied to your message with a [HELP Keyword]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/keywords/keyword_handling/#default-opt-in-opt-out-keywords) and was dispatched a HELP auto-response. A user reply is measured anytime a user sends an inbound message within four hours of receiving your message.
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

{% endif %}

### Historical Performance

The **Historical Performance** panel allows you to view the metrics from the **Message Performance** panel as a graph over time. Use the filters at the top of the panel to modify the stats and channels shown in the graph. The time range of this graph will always mirror the time range specified at the top of the page. 

To get a day-by-day breakdown, click the <i class="fas fa-bars"></i> hamburger menu and select **Download CSV** to receive a CSV export of the report.

![CC_Historical_Performance]({% image_buster /assets/img/cc-historical-performance.png %})

{% if include.channel == "in-app message" %}

{% alert note %}
If you select to only send to users who can see the latest Braze version of in-app messages (Generation 3), your **Target Audience** does not adjust to reflect your choice.
{% endalert %}

{% endif %}

{% if include.channel == "SMS" %}

### Keyword Responses

The **Keyword Responses** panel shows you a timeline of the inbound keywords users replied with after receiving your message.

![keyword_responses]({% image_buster /assets/img/sms/keyword_responses.png %})

{% endif %}

### Conversion Event Details

The **Conversion Event Details** panel shows you the performance of your conversion events for your campaign. For more information, refer to [Conversion Events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/building_campaigns/conversion_events/#step-3-view-results).

![CC_Conversion]({% image_buster /assets/img/cc-conversion.png %})

### Conversion Correlation

The **Conversion Correlation** panel gives you insight into what user attributes and behaviors help or hurt the outcomes you set for campaigns. For more information, refer to [Conversion Correlation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/testing/conversion_correlation/).

![Conversion Correlation analysis]({% image_buster /assets/img/convcorr.png %})

{% if include.channel == "SMS" %}

### SMS Currents events

Like email, Braze receives user-level events related to an SMS message as it makes its journey to a user. Any inbound SMS event will also be sent as a Currents event through the [SMS InboundReceived]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events/#sms-inbound-received-events) event. This will allow you to perform additional actions or reporting on the messages your users are texting in outside of the Braze platform. 

{% alert note %}
Inbound messages are truncated past 1600 characters.
{% endalert %}

{% endif %}

## Retention Report

Retention reports show you the rates at which your users have performed a selected retention event over time periods in a specific campaign or Canvas. For more information, refer to [Retention Reports]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/your_reports/retention_reports/).

## Funnel Report

Funnel reporting offers a visual report that allows you to analyze the journeys your customers take after receiving a campaign or Canvas. If your campaign or Canvas uses a control group or multiple variants, you will be able to understand how the different variants have impacted the conversion funnel at a more granular level and optimize based on this data.

For more information, refer to [Funnel Reports]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/your_reports/funnel_reports/).
