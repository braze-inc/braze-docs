## Viewing analytics

Once you've launched your campaign, you can return to the details page for that campaign to view key metrics. Navigate to the **Campaigns** page and select your campaign to open the details page.{% if include.channel != "banner" %} For {% if include.channel == "Content Card" %}Content Cards {% elsif include.channel == "banner" %}Banner {% elsif include.channel == "email" %}email {% elsif include.channel == "in-app message" %}in-app messages {% elsif include.channel == "push" %}push messages {% elsif include.channel == "SMS" %}SMS messages {% elsif include.channel == "whatsapp" %}WhatsApp messages {% elsif include.channel == "webhook" %}webhooks {% endif %}sent in Canvas, refer to [Canvas analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/testing_canvases/measuring_and_testing_with_canvas_analytics/).{% endif %}

From the **Campaign Analytics** tab, you can view your reports in a series of panels. You may see more or less than those listed in the sections below, but each has its own useful purpose.

### Time range

By default, the time range for **Campaign Analytics** will display the last 90 days from the current time. This means that if the campaign was launched more than 90 days ago, the analytics will display as "0" for the given time range. To view all analytics for older campaigns, adjust the reporting time range.

### Campaign details

The **Campaign Details** panel shows a high-level overview of the entire performance for your
  {% if include.channel == "banner" %}Banner. 
  {% elsif include.channel == "Content Card" %}Content Card.
  {% elsif include.channel == "email" %}email.
  {% elsif include.channel == "in-app message" %}in-app message.
  {% elsif include.channel == "push" %}push message.
  {% elsif include.channel == "SMS" %}SMS, MMS, and RCS.
  {% elsif include.channel == "whatsapp" %}WhatApp messages.
  {% elsif include.channel == "webhook" %}webhook.
  {% endif %}

Review this panel to see overall metrics such as the number of messages sent to the number of recipients, the primary conversion rate, and the total revenue generated by this message. You can also review delivery, audience, and conversion settings from this page.

{% if include.channel == "whatsapp" %}
{% alert note %}
The WhatsApp channel includes read rate. This metric is only delivered for users with read receipts on, which can vary.

In this view, you can use the **Show Heatmap** toggle to bring up a visual view of your email that shows the overall frequency and location of clicks within the lifespan of the campaign. In the **Link Table by Total Clicks** panel, you can view all of the links in your email campaign and sort by total clicks. This can provide additional insight on where your users navigate. To save a copy of the heatmap for reference, select the download button.

{% alert note %}
Regarding how impressions are logged, there are some nuances between web, Android, and iOS. Generally speaking, Braze logs an impression when a card is seen, which is after a user scrolls to the specific Content Card in their feed.
{% endalert %}

#### Unique Recipients versus Unique Impressions

There are a few metrics available that cover the visibility of your message. This includes _Unique Recipients_ and _Unique Impressions_. Let's use a few example scenarios to understand these metrics better.

Let’s say you view a Content Card today, then receive a new card from the same campaign tomorrow, and again the day after tomorrow—you will be counted as a _Unique Recipient_ three times. However, you will only be counted for one _Unique Impression_. You’ll also be included in the number of _Messages Sent_, as the card was available on your device.

As another example, suppose you see five _Unique Impressions_ on a Content Card campaign showing 150,000 _Messages Sent_. This means the card was made available (on the backend) to an audience of 150,000 users, but only five users' devices performed all of the following steps after that send occurred:

1. Started a session or the app explicitly requested a Content Cards sync (or both)
2. Navigated to the Content Cards view
3. SDK recorded an impression and logged it to the server

Your _Messages Sent_ refers to Content Cards available to be seen, while _Unique Recipients_ refers to Content Cards that were actually seen.

### Banner metrics

These are the key metrics to track while reviewing your Banner campaign performance. Clicks and impressions for Banners are tracked automatically with the SDK.

##### Deferrals

Deferred or deferral is when an email was not immediately delivered, but Braze will retry the email for up to 72 hours after this temporary delivery failure to maximize the chances of successful delivery before attempts for that specific campaign are stopped. Typical reasons for deferrals include reputation-based email volume rate-limiting from the inbox provider, temporary connectivity issues, or DNS errors.

_Deferrals_ differ from _Soft Bounces_. If no email was successfully delivered during this retry period, Braze will send one soft bounce event per attempted campaign sent. Before February 25, 2025, these retries were counted as multiple soft bounces for 1 campaign send.

Note that _Deferrals_ are currently only available using Currents or Braze Snowflake features (such as Query Builder, SQL Segment, Snowflake Data Sharing). If you’d like to include this in campaign or Canvas analytics, please [submit product feedback]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/portal).

##### Estimated real open rate {#estimated-real-open-rate}

This statistic uses a proprietary analytical model created by Braze to reconstruct an estimate of the campaign's unique open rate as if machine opens did not exist. While we receive labels of *Machine Opens* on some open events from email senders (see above), these labels can often label actual opens as machine opens. In other words, the *Other Opens* are likely an underestimate of real opens (by actual users). Instead, Braze uses click data from each campaign to infer the rate at which actual humans opened the message. This compensates for various machine opening mechanisms, including Apple’s MPP.

_Estimated Real Open Rate_ is calculated 36 hours after email sending has begun and is recalculated every 24 hours thereafter. If a campaign recurs, the estimate is recalculated 36 hours after another send occurs.

Typically around 10,000 delivered emails are required for the statistic to be computed successfully, though that number can vary depending on click rate. If the statistic can't be computed, then the column displays "--".

###### Limitations

Estimated Real Open Rate is only available in campaigns, and is not reported in Current events. This metric is only retroactively calculated for active campaigns launched before November 14, 2023.

##### Handling increases in click rates

Open rates can be an insightful metric to track for your email campaigns. However, these open rates aren't necessarily accurate indicators of human engagement with email campaigns. An open event, by definition, occurs when a user opens an email, meaning a transparent open tracking pixel was successfully downloaded. 

Additionally, use of security scanning tools can inflate open rates. Some of these tools protect their users by scanning incoming emails for malicious content by clicking links to verify their legitimacy. These clicks are often referred to as "bot clicks" or "non-human interaction" (NHI). 

Ultimately, after an email leaves our servers, we have limited visibility into what happens next, but here are recommendations for managing NHI affecting your results:

1. Be aware that this can happen to any sender and nearly any recipient. Clicks, like opens, are not entirely reliable indicators of human interaction with your messages, meaning NHI is not preventable.
2. Higher positive engagement tends to correlate with lower NHI, so it's important to follow email messaging [best practices]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/best_practices). This includes getting explicit permission from your users to send email and sunsetting unengaged subscribers on a regular cadence. 
3. Use HTTPS links in your emails when possible. NHI is less common for senders using secure links.
4. If you use a single-click unsubscribe process, consider creating a [preference center]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/preference_center/overview) that takes users to a page to edit and manage their notification preferences. This can be helpful because NHI can inadvertently unsubscribe users.
5. Consider using [other metrics]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/reporting_and_analytics/email_reporting/#email-performance) to measure your email marketing success, such as conversions, app sessions, or site visits.
6. Add a hidden link in your email campaigns. This link would be something that a human wouldn't notice like white-on-white text or a punctuation mark. Bots tend to click all links, so you can conclude that users generating click events on the invisible link are actually the result of NHI, so the open or click doesn't necessarily indicate positive engagement.

> Delivery of notifications is a “best effort” by Apple Push Notification services (APNs). It is not intended to deliver data to your app, only to notify the user that there is new data available. The important distinction is that we will display how many messages we successfully delivered to APNs, not necessarily how many APNs successfully delivered to devices.

##### Tracking unsubscribes

Push unsubscribes aren't included as a metric in campaign analytics, and depend on updates to a user’s push status from providers like Apple or Google. These updates can be infrequent and unpredictable. As a result, push unsubscribes are not included as a metric in push campaign analytics. 

However, manually tracking push unsubscribes can still provide valuable insights into user responses to your notification frequency and content relevance. Here are two options for tracking push unsubscribes: Using segment filters or custom filters.

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Segment filters %}

You can create a segment to identify users who aren't push enabled, meaning they're not subscribed or opted-in and don't have a [foreground push token]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/push/push_registration/#push-tokens). For example, to see the number of unsubscribes in your app, you would use an "OR" combination of the following segments: 

- `Background or Foreground Push Enabled is false`
- `Has Uninstalled`

![The Segment Builder section with the filter "Background or Foreground Push Enabled for App" for an app is false, and the filter "Has Uninstalled" are selected.]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_unsub_segment_example.png %})

Note the segmentation filters are approximate and can't be specifically tied to a date and campaign.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Custom filters %}

{% alert important %}
Logging a custom event for subscription change will log [data points]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/data_points#consumption-count). Alternatively, use segment filters to identify and target users who aren't push enabled.
{% endalert %}

For a different workaround, we also recommend creating a custom event for push unsubscribes based on whether a user's push enabled status is `true` or `false` in order to track this metric.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

##### Understanding opens

Even though _Direct Opens_ and _Influenced Opens_ include the word "opens", they're actually different metrics. _Direct Opens_ refers to the direct opening of a push notification, as stated in the table above. _Influenced Opens_ refers to the opening of an app, without opening a push notification within a specific time frame after receiving it. So, _Influenced Opens_ refers to the app opens, not push notification opens.

##### Why push sends can exceed unique recipients

The number of _Sends_ may exceed the number of _Unique Recipients_ due to the following reasons:

- **Re-eligibility is on:** When re-eligibility is enabled in your campaign or Canvas settings, users who meet the segment and delivery criteria can receive the same push notification multiple times. This results in a higher number of total sends.
- **Users have multiple devices:** If re-eligibility is not enabled, the difference may be explained by users having multiple devices associated with their profile. For instance, a user could have both a smartphone and tablet, and the push notification is being sent to all registered devices. Each delivery counts as a send, but only one unique recipient is recorded.
- **Users are assigned to multiple apps:** If users are associated with more than one app (such as when testing a new app), they may receive the same push notification on each app. This contributes to a higher number of sends.

##### Why bounces occur {#bounced-push}

{% tabs %}
{% tab Apple Push Notification service %}

Bounces occur in Apple Push Notification services (APNs) when a push notification attempts delivery to a device that does not have the intended app installed. APNs also has the right to change tokens for devices arbitrarily. If you attempt to send to a user’s device in which their push token has changed in between when we previously registered their token (such as at the beginning of each session when we register a user for a push token) and the time of send, this would cause a bounce.

If a user disables push within their device settings on subsequent app open the SDK will detect that push has been disabled and notify Braze. At this point we will update the push enabled state to be disabled. When a disabled user receives a push campaign before having a new session, the campaign would successfully send and appear as delivered. The push will not bounce for this user. Following a subsequent session, when you attempt to send a push to the user Braze is already aware of whether we have a foreground token as such no notification is sent.

Push notifications that expire before delivery are not considered as failed and will not be recorded as a bounce.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Firebase Cloud Messaging %}

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) bounces could occur in three cases:

| Scenario | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Uninstalled applications | When a message attempts delivery to a device and the intended app is uninstalled on that device, the message will be discarded and the device's registration ID will be invalidated. Any future attempts at messaging the device will return a NotRegistered error. |
| Backed up application | When an application is backed up, its registration ID could become invalid before the application is restored. In this case, FCM will no longer store the application's registration ID and the application will no longer receive messages. As such, registration IDs should **not** be saved when an application is backed up. |
| Updated application | When an application is updated, the previous version's registration ID may no longer work. As such, an updated application should replace its existing registration ID. |
