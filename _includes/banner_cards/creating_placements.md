### Step 1: Create placements in Braze

If you haven't already, you'll need to create Banner placements in Braze that are used to define the locations in your app or site can display Banners. To create a placement, go to **Settings** > **Banners Placements**, then select **Create Placement**.

Give your placement a name and assign a **Placement ID**. Be sure you consult other teams before assigning an ID, as it'll be used throughout the card's lifecycle and shouldn't be changed later. For more information, see [Placement IDs]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/banner_cards/#placement-ids).
