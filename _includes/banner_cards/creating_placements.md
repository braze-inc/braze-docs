### Step 1: Create placements

If you haven't already, you'll need to create Banner Card placements in Braze that are used to define the locations in your app or site can display Banner Cards. To create a placement, go to **Settings** > **Banner Cards Placements**, then select **Create Placement**.

![Banner Card Placements section to create placement IDs.]({% image_buster /assets/img/banner_cards/create_placement.png %})

Give your placement a name and assign a **Placement ID**. Be sure you consult other teams before assigning an ID, as it'll be used throughout the card's lifecycle and shouldn't be changed later. For more information, see [Placement IDs]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/banner_cards/#placement-ids).
