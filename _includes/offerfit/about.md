For example, you could build a repeat purchase use case to increase follow-up conversions after an initial sale. You define the audience and message in Braze, while OfferFit runs daily experiments, automatically testing different combinations of product offers, message timing, and frequency for each customer. Over time, OfferFit learns what works best and orchestrates personalized sends through Braze to maximize repurchase rates.

Building a good use case consists of:

- Choosing a success metric for OfferFit to optimize for, such as revenue, conversions, or ARPU.
- Defining which dimensions to test, such as offer, subject line, creative, channel, or send time.
