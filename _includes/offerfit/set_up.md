## Setting up OfferFit

The following is intended to give a high-level overview of what you can expect from a typical set up for OfferFit by Braze.

### Step 1: Onboarding and Discovery

Once you have an active OfferFit by Braze license, our AI Expert Services team will engage your team in a range of onboarding and discovery activities. This process helps us collect the information that enables our team to craft the a use case that most effectively drives the business outcome you care about.

### Step 2: Use Case Design and Delivery

Leveraging the information collected during the first phase, our AI Expert Services team will work with you to define the details of your OfferFit use case. These include decisions such as:

- The audience that you plan to target with OfferFit
- The success metric that most aligns with your business goals, such as net revenue, conversions, or ARPU.
- The range of dimensions to test along, such as offer, subject line, creative, channel, and frequency.
- The range of options the AI can combine, such as the type and value of offers, subject lines and creatives, available channels (e.g. email, SMS, and/or Push), and weekly send frequency.

Once finalized, our team will work with you to implement any technical prerequisites, including but not limited to adjustments to marketing automation and business logic, data pipeline set up, and end-to-end testing. 

### Step 3: Go-Live and Ramp-Up

Once any required technical work is complete, our team will work with you to orchestrate the transition of your target audience from any existing treatment to OfferFit by Braze. This transition usually occurs in multiple ramp-up steps, starting with a small percentage of the audience before eventually ramping up to a majority.

In this time, the AI Expert Services team will tune the OfferFit AI, respond to any issues, and work with you to provide continuous performance updates and insights. 

### Step 4: Ongoing Delivery

Even after the set up is complete and the use case is performant, our AI Expert Services team will continue to closely supervise the use case, respond to any questions you may have, and facilitate any updates, design adjustments, or expansions.
