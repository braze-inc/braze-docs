## About agents

### How it works

An agent is a custom configuration for BrazeAI Decisioning Studio™ that's tailor-made to meet a specific business goal.

For example, you could build a repeat purchase agent to increase follow-up conversions after an initial sale. You define the audience and message in Braze, while the decisioning studio runs daily experiments, automatically testing different combinations of product offers, message timing, and frequency for each customer. Over time, BrazeAI™ learns what works best and orchestrates personalized sends through Braze to maximize repurchase rates.

Designing a good agent consists of:

- Choosing a success metric for BrazeAI™ to optimize for, such as revenue, conversions, or ARPU
- Defining which dimensions to test, such as offer, subject line, creative, channel, or send time.
- Selecting the options for each dimension, such as email versus SMS, or daily versus weekly frequency.
