# Use case: PRODUCT_FUNCTIONALITY

<!-- The description starts with a '>' character and discusses what will be covered. This section should demonstrate the value of the product by describing a real-world, common scenario of the way that Braze is used by customers.-->
> DESCRIPTION.

<!-- The introduction is a paragraph that introduces the fictionalized scenario that the user will roleplay. Describe the end state that the use case tutorial will provide the fictional user. For example, the end state might be that the user will have created an in-app message that will create a user segment for all users who have asked to be notified when a new show debuts on a streaming platform. -->
INTRODUCTION.
- END_STATE
- END_STATE

STEP 1: PERFORM SOME ACTION

STEP 2: PERFORM ANOTHER ACTION

STEP 3: END STATE

<!-- The content of the use case should be step-by-step instructions for the user to follow. Be explicit about basic things: where to do things and where to put them. Discuss why the user would make the fictional choices they're making. The goal of the use case is to create an example that resembles a "real world" artifact, and can later be adapted into a real application using the user's own data and industry standards. Be clear that this is a fictional example so the user feels safe with experimenting and doesn't make a mistake with real-world consequences. -->
