## Prerequisites

Before you can use this feature, you'll need to [set up the Braze MCP server]{% if include.section == "user" %}({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/mcp_server/setup/){% elsif include.section == "developer" %}({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/mcp_server/setup/){% endif %}.

## Best practices

When using the Braze MCP server through natural-language tools like Claude and Cursor, keep these tips in mind to get the best results:

- LLMs can make mistakes, so always be sure to double-check their answers.
- For data analysis, be clear about the time range you need. Shorter ranges often give more accurate results.
- Use exact [Braze terminology](https://www.braze.com/resources/articles/glossary) so your LLM calls the right function.
- If results seem incomplete, prompt your LLM to continue or dig deeper.
- Try creative prompts! Depending on your MCP client, you may be able to export a CSV or other useful files.

## Usage examples

After [setting up the Braze MCP server]{% if include.section == "user" %}({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/mcp_server/setup/){% elsif include.section == "developer" %}({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/mcp_server/setup/){% endif %}, you can interact with Braze through natural language using tools like Claude or Cursor.
