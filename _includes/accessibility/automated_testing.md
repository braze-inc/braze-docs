[Automated accessibility testing]({{site.baseurl}}/help/accessibility/#automated-accessibility-testing) helps catch common issues like missing alt text or low color contrast based on WCAG Level AA standards. It’s a powerful starting point for building more inclusive messages.

But automation can’t catch everything. Some issues need a human eye—like whether the focus order makes sense, if links and buttons are clearly labeled, or if your instructions are easy to follow. Think of these checks as a diagnostic tool, not a final verdict. We recommend reviewing flagged issues manually and using your best judgment when something is marked as “Needs review.”

For extra support, our [Accessibility at Braze]({{site.baseurl}}/help/accessibility) guide shares practical tips for making your content easier for everyone to use, including:

- [Headings and structure]({{site.baseurl}}/help/accessibility/#content)
- [Alt text and images]({{site.baseurl}}/help/accessibility/#images)

- [Color contrast]({{site.baseurl}}/help/accessibility/#color-contrast)
- [Touch targets]({{site.baseurl}}/help/accessibility/#touch-targets)

When you combine automated testing with thoughtful manual review, you’ll catch more issues—and create a better experience for all your users.
