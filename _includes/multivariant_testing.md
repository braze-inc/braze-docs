{% if include.section == "Variant distribution" %}

The distribution between variants is not always even. Here's how variant distribution works.

Every time a message is sent in a multivariate campaign, the system independently selects a random option according to the percentages you set and assigns a variant based on the result. It's like flipping a coinâ€”anomalies are possible. If you've ever flipped a coin 100 times, you know that you probably won't get an exact 50-50 split between heads and tails every time, even though you only have two choices. You might get 52 heads and 48 tails.

If you have multiple variants that you want to split evenly, you also need to make sure the number of variants is a multiple of 100. Otherwise, some variants will have a higher percentage of users distributed to that variant compared to others. For example, if your campaign has 7 variants, there can't be an even variant distribution since 7 does not equally divide by 100 as a whole number. In this case, you would have 2 variants of 15% and 5 variants of 14%.

#### Note on in-app messages

When running an A/B test on in-app messages, your analytics may appear to show a higher variant distribution between one variant and another, even if they have an even percentage split. For example, consider the following graph of *Unique Recipients* for Variant A and Variant C.

![Graph of Unique Recipients for two variants with a similar shape between Variant A and Variant C, where Variant A has a higher Unique Recipients count per day]({% image_buster /assets/img/variant_distribution_iam.png %})

Variant A has a consistently higher count of *Unique Recipients* than Variant C. This isn't due to variant distribution, but rather how *Unique Recipients* are calculated for in-app messages. For in-app messages, *Unique Recipients* are actually *Unique Impressions*, which is the total number of people who received and viewed the in-app message. This means if a user doesn't receive the message for whatever reason or decides not to view it, they are not included in the *Unique Recipients* count, and the variant distribution can appear skewed.
