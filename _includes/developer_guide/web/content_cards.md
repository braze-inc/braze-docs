## Prerequisites

Before you can use Content Cards, you'll need to [integrate the Braze Web SDK]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/sdk_integration/?sdktab=web) into your app. However, no additional setup is required. To build your own UI instead, see [Content Card Customization Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/content_cards/).

## Standard feed UI

To use the included Content Cards UI, you'll need to specify where to show the feed on your website. 

In this example, we have a `<div id="feed"></div>` in which we want to place the Content Cards feed. We'll use three buttons to hide, show, or toggle (hide or show based on its current state) the feed.

```html

<button id="toggle" type="button">Toggle Cards Feed</button>
<button id="hide" type="button">Hide Cards Feed</button>
<button id="show" type="button">Show Cards Feed</button>

<nav>
    <h1>Your Personalized Feed</h1>
    <div id="feed"></div>
</nav>

<script> 
   const toggle = document.getElementById("toggle");
   const hide = document.getElementById("hide");
   const show = document.getElementById("show");
   const feed = document.getElementById("feed");
    
   toggle.onclick = function(){
      braze.toggleContentCards(feed);    
   }
    
   hide.onclick = function(){
      braze.hideContentCards();
   }
    
   show.onclick = function(){
      braze.showContentCards(feed);    
   }
</script>
```

When using the `toggleContentCards(parentNode, filterFunction)` and `showContentCards(parentNode, filterFunction)` methods, if no arguments are provided, all Content Cards will be shown in a fixed-position sidebar on the right-hand side of the page. Otherwise, the feed will be placed in the specified `parentNode` option.

|Parameters | Description |
|---|---|
|`parentNode` | The HTML node to render the Content Cards into. If the parent node already has a Braze Content Cards view as a direct descendant, the existing Content Cards will be replaced. For example, you should pass in `document.querySelector(".my-container")`.|
|`filterFunction` | A filter or sort function for cards displayed in this view. Invoked with the array of `Card` objects, sorted by `{pinned, date}`. Expected to return an array of sorted `Card` objects to render for this user. If omitted, all cards will be displayed. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation" }

[See the SDK reference docs](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/modules/braze.html#togglecontentcards) for more information on Content Card toggling.

## Card types and properties

The Content Cards data model is available in the Web SDK and offers the following Content Card types: [ImageOnly](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/classes/braze.imageonly.html), [CaptionedImage](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/classes/braze.captionedimage.html), and [ClassicCard](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/classes/braze.classiccard.html). Each type inherits common properties from a base model [Card](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/classes/braze.card.html) and has the following additional properties.

{% alert tip %}
To log Content Card data, see [Logging analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/content_cards/logging_analytics/).

{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation" }

## Control group

If you use the default Content Cards feed, impressions and clicks will be automatically tracked.

If you use a custom integration for Content Cards, you need need [log impressions]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/content_cards/logging_analytics/) when a Control Card would have been seen. As part of this effort, make sure to handle Control cards when logging impressions in an A/B test. These cards are blank, and while they arenâ€™t seen by users, you should still log impressions in order to compare how they perform against non-Control cards.

To determine if a Content Card is in the Control group for an A/B test, check the `card.isControl` property (Web SDK v4.5.0+) or check if the card is a `ControlCard` instance (`card instanceof braze.ControlCard`).

## Card methods

|Method | Description |
|---|---|
|[`logContentCardImpressions`](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/modules/braze.html#logcontentcardimpressions)| Logs an impression event for the given list of cards. This is required when using a customized UI and not the Braze UI.|

For more details, refer to the [SDK reference documentation](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/modules/braze.html)

## Using Google Tag Manager

Google Tag Manager works by injecting the [Braze CDN]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/initial_sdk_setup#install-cdn) (a version of our Web SDK) directly into your website code, which means that all SDK methods are available just as if you had integrated the SDK without Google Tag Manager, except when implementing Content Cards.

### Setting up Content Cards

{% tabs local %}
{% tab google tag manager %}
For a standard integration of the Content Card feed, you can use a **Custom HTML** tag in Google Tag Manager. Add the following to your Custom HTML tag, which will activate the standard Content Card feed:

```html
<script>
   window.braze.showContentCards();
</script>
```

![Tag Configuration in Google Tag Manager of a Custom HTML tag that shows the Content Card feed.]({% image_buster /assets/img/web-gtm/gtm_content_cards.png %})
{% endtab %}

{% tab manual %}
For more freedom over customizing the appearance of Content Cards and their feed, you can directly integrate Content Cards into your native website. There are two approaches you can take with this: using the standard feed UI or creating a custom feed UI.

{% subtabs local %}
{% subtab standard feed %}
When implementing the [standard feed UI]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/content_cards/integration/#standard-feed-ui), Braze methods must have `window.` added to the start of the method. For example, `braze.showContentCards` should instead be `window.braze.showContentCards`.
{% endsubtab %}

{% subtab custom feed %}
For [custom feed]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/content_cards/creating_cards/) styling, the steps are the same as if you had integrated the SDK without GTM. For example, if you want to customize the width of the Content Card feed, you can paste the following into your CSS file:

{% raw %}
```css
body .ab-feed { 
    width: 800px;
}
```
{% endraw %}
{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Upgrading templates {#upgrading}

To upgrade to the latest version of the Braze Web SDK, take the following three steps in your Google Tag Manager dashboard:

1. **Update tag template**<br>Go to the **Templates** page within your workspace. Here you should see an icon indicating an update is available.<br><br>![Templates page showing an update is available]({% image_buster /assets/img/web-gtm/gtm-update-available.png %})<br><br>Click that icon and after reviewing the change, click to **Accept Update**.<br><br>![A screen comparing the old and new tag templates with a button to "Accept Update"]({% image_buster /assets/img/web-gtm/gtm-accept-update.png %})<br><br>
2. **Update version number**<br>Once your tag template has been updated, edit the Braze Initialization Tag, and update the SDK version to the most recent `major.minor` version. For example, if the latest version is `4.1.2`, enter `4.1`. You can view a list of SDK versions in our [changelog](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-web-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).<br><br>![Braze Initialization Template with an input field to change the SDK Version]({% image_buster /assets/img/web-gtm/gtm-version-number.png %})<br><br>
3. **QA and publish**<br>Verify the new SDK version is working using Google Tag Manager's [debugging tool](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6107056?hl=en) prior to publishing an update to your tag container.

### Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

#### Enable tag debugging {#debugging}

Each Braze tag template has an optional **GTM Tag Debugging** checkbox which can be used to log debug messages to your web page's JavaScript console.

![Google Tag Manager's Debug tool]({% image_buster /assets/img/web-gtm/gtm-tag-debugging.png %})

#### Enter debug mode

Another way to help debug your Google Tag Manager integration is using Google's [Preview mode](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6107056) feature.

This will help identify what values are being sent from your web page's data layer to each triggered Braze tag and will also explain which tags were or were not triggered.

![The Braze Initialization Tag summary page provides an overview of the tag, including information on which tags were triggered.]({% image_buster /assets/img/web-gtm/gtm-debug-mode.png %})

#### Enable verbose logging

To allow Braze technical support to access logs while testing, you can enable verbose logging on your Google Tag Manager integration. These logs will appear in the **Console** tab of your browser's [developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools).

In your Google Tag Manager integration, navigate to your Braze Initialization Tag and select **Enable Web SDK Logging**.
