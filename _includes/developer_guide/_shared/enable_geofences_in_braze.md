You can enable geofences for your app in one of the following places:

{% tabs local %}
{% tab locations %}
To enable geofences from the **Locations** page:

1. In Braze, go to **Audience** > **Locations**.
2. The number of apps in your workspace that have geofences enabled is listed under the map. For example, if geofences is only enabled for some of your apps, it may read: **2 of 5 Apps with Geofences enabled**. To enable additional apps, select the current count under the map.
3. Choose an app to enable geofences for, then select **Done.**
