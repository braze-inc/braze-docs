## About Xamarin Content Cards

The Braze Xamarin SDK includes a default card feed to get you started with Content Cards. The default card feed included with the Braze SDK will handle all analytics tracking, dismissals, and rendering for a userâ€™s Content Cards.

## Card types and properties

The Braze Xamarin SDK has three unique Content Cards card types that share a base model: [Banner](#banner), [Captioned Image](#captioned-image), and [Classic](#classic). Each type inherits common properties from a base model and has the following additional properties.

### Base card model

|Property           | Description                                                                                                            |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`idString`         | The card's ID set by Braze.                                                                                            |
|`created`          | The UNIX timestamp of the card's creation time from Braze.                                                             |
|`expiresAt`        | The UNIX timestamp of the card's expiration time. When the value is less than 0, it means the card never expires.      |
|`viewed`           | Whether the card is read or unread by the user. This does not log analytics.                                           |
|`clicked`          | Whether the card has been clicked by the user.                                                                         |
|`pinned`           | Whether the card is pinned.                                                                                            |
|`dismissed`        | Whether the user has dismissed this card. Marking a card as dismissed that has already been dismissed will be a no-op. |
|`dismissible`      | Whether the card is dismissible by the user.                                                                           |
|`urlString`        | (Optional) The url string associated with the card click action.                                                       |
|`openUrlInWebView` | Whether URLs for this card should be opened in Braze's WebView or not.                                                 |
|`isControlCard`    | Whether this card is a control card. Control cards should not be displayed to the user.                                |
|`extras`           | The map of key-value extras for this card.                                                                             |
|`isTest`           | Whether this card is a test card.                                                                                      |
