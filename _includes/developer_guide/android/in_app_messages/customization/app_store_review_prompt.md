# Google Play review prompt

> This reference article covers Google Play in-app review prompt options for your Android or FireOS application.

Due to the limitations and restrictions set by Google, custom Google Play review prompts are not currently supported by Braze. While some users have been able to integrate these prompts successfully, others have shown low success rates due to [Google Play quotas](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review#quotas). Integrate at your own risk. Refer to documentation on [Google Play in-app review prompts](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review).
