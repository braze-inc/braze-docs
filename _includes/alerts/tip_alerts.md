{% alert tip %}
You can use [Liquid]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/) in the **From Display Name + Address** and **Reply-To Address** fields to dynamically template these based on custom attributes. This allows you to send from different brands, regions, or departments using a single email campaign or Canvas step.
