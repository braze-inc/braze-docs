## Using in-app message editor blocks

Editor blocks are located under the **Build** section for in-app messages. To use them, drag an editor block inside a column. It will auto-adjust to the column width. Each editor block has its own settings, such as granular control on padding. The right-side panel automatically switches to a property panel for the selected content element.

### Types

The following table describes how you can use each editor block type.
