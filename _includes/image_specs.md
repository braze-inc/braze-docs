We recommend the following payload sizes:

{% if include.variable_name == "in-app messages" %}

Modal in-app messages are designed to fit the device at the best and most filling ratios possible, while staying true to the size and ratios of your chosen image or copy for your message.

While there are no limits to how many text characters you can include in an in-app message (as well as buttons, headline, main body, and others), we moderate how many text characters you use. Too much text will require users to expand and scroll the message.

All in-app messages have a recommended image size of 500 KB, maximum image size of 5 MB, and support PNG, JPG, and GIF file types.
