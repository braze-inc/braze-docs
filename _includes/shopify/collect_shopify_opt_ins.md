You have the option to collect your email or SMS marketing opt-ins from Shopify. 

If you use the email or SMS channels, you can sync your email and SMS marketing opt-in states into Braze. If you sync email marketing opt-ins from Shopify, Braze will automatically create an email subscription group for all users associated with that specific store. You need to create a unique name for this subscription group.

As mentioned in [Shopify overview]({{site.baseurl}}/shopify_overview/), if you want to use a third-party capture form, your developers need to integrate Braze SDK code. This will let you capture the email address and global email subscription status from form submissions. Specifically, you need to implement and test these methods to your `theme.liquid` file:<br><br>
- [setEmail](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/classes/braze.user.html#setemail): Sets the email address on the user profile
- [setEmailNotificationSubscriptionType](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/classes/braze.user.html#setemailnotificationsubscriptiontype): Updates the global email subscription status
