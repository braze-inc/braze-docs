## Quick start

> [!TIP]
> For a full walkthrough, see [Contributing to Braze Docs](https://www.braze.com/docs/contributing/home/).

To build the docs locally, you'll need Ruby version `3.3.0` installed. In the terminal, open `braze-docs` and check for Ruby version `3.3.0`.

```bash
cd ~/braze-docs
ruby --version
```

If this version isn't installed, use a [supported version manager](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#managers) to install it. For example, using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv):

```bash
rbenv install 3.3.0
```

Next, install project dependencies.

```bash
bundle install
```

To start your local docs server on localhost `http://127.0.0.1:4000`, run the following command. To stop your server, reopen the terminal and press **Control**+**C**.

```bash
# for 'en' language:
rake

# for other langauges:
rake es
rake fr
rake ja
rake ko
rake pt_br

# to render content in '{% markdown_embed %}' tags:
MARKDOWN_API=true rake

# to render tiles on partner landing pages:
PARTNER_API=true rake

# to render both APIs:
MARKDOWN_API=true PARTNER_API=true rake
```

> [!NOTE]
> Prepending `MARKDOWN_API=true` to your rake command lets you preview content within a `{% markdown_embed %}` tag, such as the content on the [Developer Guide: Changelogs](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/changelogs/) page. Prepending `PARTNER_API=true` lets you render the tiles on a partner landing page, such as [Technology Partners](https://www.braze.com/docs/partners/home/).
