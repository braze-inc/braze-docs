  users.messages.pushnotification.Open:
    description: This event occurs when a user directly clicks on the Push notification to open the application. Currently, Push Open Events refer specifically to "Direct Opens" rather than "Total Opens". This does not include statistics shown at the campaign level of "influenced opens" as these are not attributed at the user level.
    api_tags:
      - Push
      - Opens
    alert_note: |
      In rare cases, a push open may appear before the corresponding push send event in Currents data because of the following:
      - Your SDK has an incorrect clock.
      - High batch write latency. The recorded send time can lag behind early deliveries, so very quick opens may be logged before the batch's final send timestamp is written. Large sends are dispatched and recorded in batches.

  users.messages.sms.InboundReceive:
    description: |
      This event occurs when one of your users sends an SMS to a phone number in one of your Braze SMS subscription groups.

      When Braze receives an inbound SMS, we attribute that inbound message to any user that shares that phone number. As a result, you may receive multiple events per inbound message if multiple users in your Braze instance share the same phone number. If you require attribution of specific user IDs based on previous messages sent to that user, you can use the SMS Delivered event to attribute Inbound Received events to the user ID who most recently received a message from your Braze number.

      If we detect that this inbound message is a reply to an outbound campaign or Canvas component sent from Braze, we will also include the campaign or Canvas metadata with the event. Braze defines a reply as an inbound message coming within four hours of an outbound message. However, there is a one-minute cache for the attributed campaign information of the last outbound SMS received.

  users.behaviors.Uninstall:
    description: This event occurs when a user uninstalls an app. Use this data to track when users uninstall an app. While this is currently a message engagement event, this will be changed to a user behavior event in the future.

Braze sends a daily silent push to determine if the app still exists on your user's device, and if we get an error on that silent push, it is assumed the app has been uninstalled.
