# SCIM API objects and appendix

## Permissions object

The permissions object is a field found in some of the requests and responses when interfacing with the user resource through SCIM ID permissions.

{% alert note %}
App groups have been renamed to workspaces in Braze, but the keys on this page still reference the old terminology (for example, `appGroup`, `appGroupName`).
{% endalert %}

```

  "permissions": {
