## Use cases

This integration allows you to selectively export users (referred to as actors in Scuba) based on specific property values and then load these users into your Braze instance. In Scuba, custom actor properties are used to analyze behavioral trends, activate your data across various platforms, and conduct predictive modeling using Machine Learning.

## Integration

This integration is invoked via a single REST API call to Scuba, wherein you provide your credentials and details of your target segments/behaviors in Scuba. and 

### Step 1: Gather Details

To use this integration, you can make a single webhook request to Scuba. In this HTTP request, you will provide your credentials along with the details of your target segments and behaviors in Scuba. Ensure you have gathered all the requirements mentioned above before we format the example request.

### Step 2: Create an invoke the HTTP Request to load your data

To perform the data load, make an **HTTP POST** request to the connector url **https://scuba.pliant.io/a/scuba-connectors/prod/braze-activation** and include the required inputs in the request's JSON body. Include a header indicating content-type: application/json.

```
curl -X POST "https://scuba.pliant.io/a/scuba-connectors/prod/braze-activation" \
-H "content-type: application/json" \
-d '{"braze_host":"<<insert Braze REST endpoint here>>", \
"braze_api_key":"<<insert Braze REST API key here>>", \
"scuba_host":"<<insert Scuba Hostname here>>", \
"scuba_token":"<<insert Scuba API Token here>>", \
"scuba_table_name":"<<insert Scuba Table Name here>>", \
"scuba_actor_property_name":"<<insert Scuba Actor Property Name here>>", \
"scuba_actor_property_value_filter":"<<insert Scuba Actor Property Value Filter here>>" \
"scuba_actor_id":"<<insert Scuba Actor ID here>>", \
"scuba_period_start":"<<insert Scuba Period Start here>>", \
"scuba_period_end":"<<insert Scuba Period End here>>", \
"scuba_record_limit":"<<OPTIONAL: insert Scuba Record Limit here>>"}'
```
 
### Data Load from Scuba to Braze: Method and Limitations
> The demonstrated method for initiating the data load from Scuba to Braze uses a CURL command. However, for enhanced usability and better management of API requests, it is recommended to utilize an API client, such as Postman.

### Default Behavior
> - This integration's default setting configures `update_existing_only` to `false`. In this context, setting `update_existing_only` to `false` allows the integration to create new records in Braze if they do not already exist, in addition to updating existing records.

### Rate Limit Considerations
> - To comply with Braze API rate limits, this endpoint restricts the number of entities processed to a maximum of 50,000 per minute.


## Creating a segment from Scuba's behavioral data 

Utilizing the behavioral actor properties of users we've imported to Braze, we can create segments of these users in Braze.

1. Navigate to Audience > Segments. Click "Create Segment" and provide a segment name.
   ![Create Segment][501]

2. Now within the Segment Details section, navigate to the Filters section, and click "Select Filter". Choose "Custom Attributes" from the dropdown menu.
   ![Select Custom Attribute Filter][502]

3. Click "Search custom attributes" in the newly created filter. Here, you will see your actor property name from Scuba as one of the custom attributes. Select this attribute.
   ![Select Actor Property][503]

4. Right of the selected actor property name, choose the preferred evaluation operator (equals, by default) and value (if applicable). Your choices will vary depending on how your actor properties are defined in Scuba. In this example, we're simply checking if the value is equal to **true**. A more trivial example could use "is not blank" without a target value.
   ![Evaluation Operator(s)][504]

5. Click "Save" at the bottom of the Segment Details section to save the new segment.
