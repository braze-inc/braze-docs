# MetaRouter
MetaRouter elevates your Braze experience by seamlessly integrating as a powerful server-side tag management platform. It empowers you to orchestrate a complete customer data journey within Braze, from reliable fully first-party data collection enriched by up to 30%, to real-time event stream activation for personalized journeys. This translates to deeper customer insights, more sophisticated journeys, and ultimately, a maximized return on investment in Braze. Additionally, MetaRouter streamlines implementation by eliminating the need for Braze tags or other third-party tags, granting you granular, parameter-by-parameter control over the data flowing into Braze.
