| [POST /users/export/ids](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/export/user_data/post_users_identifier/)                          | OfferFit can use this endpoint to retrieve the list of customers to be targeted by a campaign or canvas. As OfferFit does not accept any PII data, we are leveraging the `fields_to_export` attribute to only retrieve the data attributes agreed together with the platform user. |
| [POST /users/export/segment](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/export/user_data/post_users_segment/)                         | OfferFit can use this endpoint to retrieve all the users that are part of a specific Segment. As previously mentioned, OfferFit does not accept any PII data, so the `fields_to_export` attribute is used to only retrieve non-PII fields, as agreed together with the platform user. |
| [POST /users/track](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track/)                                            | OfferFit can use this endpoint to update user profiles with custom data attributes that can be used to personalize messaging.                                                                                                                                            |

## Use cases

Lifecycle marketers know that when it comes to engaging their customers, practice beats theory. No matter
how brilliant a campaign, email subject, ad, or creative seems on paper, the only way to know if an idea
works is to try it out with customers. Traditionally, marketers have tried out their ideas through A/B testing,
but A/B testing is slow and doesn’t scale with the number of variables marketers need to test. OfferFit’s
**self learning** platform allows marketers to automate the process of experimentation.
Marketers use OfferFit to optimize campaigns to existing identified customers, with business goals such as
cross-sell, upsell, repurchase, retention, renewal, referral, and winback. To implement OfferFit, marketers:
1. Choose a **success metric** they want to maximize, such as revenue, conversions, ARPU, or any other
KPI they can measure from their data. This is the metric OfferFit’s AI will try to maximize.
2. Choose **dimensions** along which to test (e.g., offer, subject line, creative, channel, time, day,
frequency, etc.)
3. Finally, choose the **options** available for each dimension. For example the options for the “channel”
dimension might be email, SMS and push; while the options for the “frequency” dimension might be
daily, twice a week, and weekly.

![of_use_case_example][2]

OfferFit’s AI then **automates the process of experimentation**. OfferFit makes daily recommendations
for each customer, seeking to maximize the chosen success metric. The AI learns from every customer
interaction, and applies these insights to the next day‘s recommendations.

## Integration

### Step 1: Define target audience in Braze

To define your target audience, you will need to create one or multiple segments in Braze. This audience will be used to send your campaign or canvas to the right users.

### Step 2: Configure API-triggered Braze Campaign or Canvas and create campaign assets (e.g. HTML templates, images)

You will need to create at least a Campaign or Canvas in Braze. This campaign or canvas will be used by OfferFit to send 1:1 personalized activation events to the right users from your defined audience. Because OfferFit will use its own Control Group, you should disable the Braze Control Group to ensure that you do not have 2 control groups active at the same time. Depending on the dimensions that you want to experiment on, you have the ability to configure liquid tags in your creative content (e.g. subject line, call to action, offer type, etc.) to dynamically populate the content of your campaign or canvas using OfferFit recommendations. The OfferFit platform can pass the customer-specific personalized content via the Braze API to automatically populate the liquid tags in your templates.

### Step 3: Update your OfferFit use case configuration to orchestrate Braze activation events 

You can leverage the OfferFit native activation integration with Braze to orchestrate and schedule 1:1 personalized recommendations for your target audience.


## Customization

In addition to orchestrating activation events in Braze, OfferFit also provides data integration capabilities that allow marketers to retrieve customer profile (non-PII) and engagement data from Braze through the available API endpoints.

## Using this integration

Once configured, the OfferFit automated experimentation platform will automatically send 1:1 personalized activation events to Braze for each user in your target audience. These activation events will be triggered through the Braze campaigns or canvases you have configured in step 2 for the OfferFit experiment.

In addition to the analytics data available in Braze, OfferFit also provides a comprehensive reporting layer that allows marketers to explore the customer insights discovered by OfferFit through its self-learning AI capabilities.
