### Step 3: Configure Job
Within the **Configure Job** prompt, provide a label and an optional description. Next, From the **Braze External User ID Field** input, select the field in Lytics that contains the Braze External User ID (`braze_id`).  The next step is the most important - select the audiences to export to Braze.

![][5]{: style="max-width:80%;"}

Finally, choose the preferable option for the **Existing Users** checkbox. Leaving this box checked will add users who already exist in the selected Lytics audience. If unchecked, users will only be exported to Braze when entering or exiting the audience after the workflow begins. Select **Complete** when finished to initiate the export and save.

{% alert note %}
By checking this box, all existing users in the selected audience will be pushed into Braze. This will result in a data point being incurred per user per audience for the initial sync.
{% endalert %}


![][6]{: style="max-width:80%;"}

After the Export Job is configured, Lytics will send the selected audiences to Braze via the native integration. For reference, below is a sample audience showing the JSON strucure of the audience sent to Braze.

`{
    "lytics_to_braze_audience": [{
            "external_id": "ABC124ID",
            "lytics_segments": {
                "add": [
                    "lytics_all",
                    "lytics_new"
                ]
            }
        },
        {
            "external_id": "XYZ234ID",
            "lytics_segments": {
                "add": [
                    "lytics_known"
                ],
                "remove": [
