## Applicable Industry Standards and Best Practices

Notwithstanding the above, in the event that Customer sends Mobile Messages using “Bring Your Own (BYO) SMS Connector” model,  the Mobile Message Providers involved in the sending shall be deemed Third-Party Providers (as defined in the Agreement) and not Sub-processors of Braze, and the disclaimers below shall apply to such Third Party Providers.

## Webhook Use Exception Terms

Applicable to Customers who have subscribed to Message Credits on or after December 9, 2024 (as per the Order Form Effective Date): the restrictions outlined in the Webhooks Channel Compliance Documentation do not apply to the use of webhooks for sending Mobile Messages through a Third Party Provider platform to destinations identified as “SMS/MMS Global” in the applicable Credit Ratio Table for Message Credits.

## Disclaimers

Braze disclaims any representations, warranties, liability and indemnification obligations with regards to any Third-Party Provider or Mobile Messages Intermediaries involved in the sending or processing of Mobile Messages, including liability related to system capacity, message throughput, or actual delivery to an End User’s device.

## General Terms

Without limiting the generality of any Customer obligations under the Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, Customer shall be solely responsible for obtaining all necessary rights, consents, and authorizations, and providing legally adequate privacy notices in connection with its use of this Channel and obtaining all legally required consents and authorizations for sending, or receiving as applicable, Messages through this Channel.
