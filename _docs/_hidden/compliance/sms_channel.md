Notwithstanding the above, in the event that Customer sends Mobile Messages using “Bring Your Own (BYO) SMS Connector” model,  the Mobile Message Providers involved in the sending shall be deemed Third-Party Providers (as defined in the Agreement) and not Sub-processors of Braze, and the disclaimers below shall apply to such Third Party Providers.
