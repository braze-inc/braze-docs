# Compliance Documentation for Webhooks ("Webhooks Channel")

_Revision Date: 22 May 2024_

_(Effective as of the Revision Date; subject to change)_

The following additional terms apply in relation to Customer’s use of the Webhooks Channel:

## Webhooks Channel Use Terms

Unless otherwise permitted in the applicable Channel Compliance Documentation, 
(a) Customer shall not use webhooks where Braze offers native capabilities to achieve the same outcome, and
(b) Customer shall not use a webhook to trigger the sending of any Message through a Third-Party Provider platform to the extent Braze provides a native mechanism to send such Messages through the Braze Services.

If Braze makes a new or updated mechanism generally available in the Braze Services during Customer’s current Subscription Term, then Customer will be prohibited from using webhooks to trigger Message sending through the specified Third-Party Platform as of six (6) months after the general release date of the new mechanism or at the end of the current year of the Customer’s Subscription Term, whichever is later.

## Disclaimer

Braze disclaims all liability with regards to Customer’s use of webhooks to trigger the sending of any Message or any other actions outside of the Braze Services.

## General terms

Without limiting the generality of any Customer obligations under the Agreement, and solely for the avoidance of doubt, Customer shall be solely responsible for obtaining all necessary rights, consents, and authorizations and providing legally adequate privacy notices in connection with its use of this Channel and obtaining all legally required consents and authorizations for sending, or receiving as applicable, Messages through this Channel.
