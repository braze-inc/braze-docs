# Page Title

{% multi_lang_include video.html id="XY5uXoKIvFY" align="right" %}

>  This type of article explains a concept and contains specific information about technical processes and product content (Canvas Steps, Segmentation, a specific type of Object etc.). The other type of Reference template is a Glossary. This format is not used for our API glossary or reference documentation unless there is a specific concept that needs to be explained. Be sure to outline that they will learn [this](#what-is-x-concept), [that](#topic-1-regarding-this-concept), and [the other](#topic-2-regarding-this-concept) on this page. This is a [good sample of a reference doc](https://guide.meteor.com/code-style.html). This is a good example of a [very technical reference doc](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp).

> Make sure to tell them they should watch the video to learn more.

## Topic 1 Regarding this Concept

This should explain a specific aspect of this concept, like how a specific type of Canvas Step is used in combination with a channel. If you would like to see an example of how to do this thing in the wild, Check out [this link to that tutorial]().


### Code Sample

If you're explaining a technical concept, note that here and show a code sample.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

Make sure you define parameters or elements that users might have to adjust from the code sample. Many users will just copy and paste.

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Page Title | You can title your page anything. You have to have this. |
| My First Heading | We recommend putting this in caps. This is also optional. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation" }

## Topic 2 Regarding this concept

In the event that a second topic is added, be sure to distinguish it from the first concept immediately. Then, go into explaining the concept. You should feel free to add diagrams!
