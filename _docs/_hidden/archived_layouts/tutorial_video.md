Focuses on a single topic (like, how to create a campaign, how to create a Canvas, etc.) Goal or Task-Oriented Article that walks STEP BY STEP through solving a SPECIFIC issue (How to target specific users, how to segment based on location, etc.).

# How to Title This Video Tutorial

> This article will walk you through doing XYZ. By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to A, B, and C!

## Step 1: Do the first thing

This is what you'll be accomplishing in this step. Here is how you can reproduce it.

Make sure you [link to other references as you need them]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/reference_video/).

### Code Sample

If you're explaining a technical concept, note that here and show a code sample.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

Make sure you define parameters or elements that users might have to adjust from the code sample. Many users will just copy and paste.

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Page Title | You can title your page anything. You have to have this. |
| My First Heading | We recommend putting this in caps. This is also optional. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation" }


## Step 2: Do the next thing

This is what you'll be accomplishing in this step. Here is how you can reproduce it.

If this step needs to be broken down into additional steps, you can either:
1. Use numbers or bullets, or
2. Use an H3 header.

### This is also part of step two

Note that this sub-step will NOT appear in the TOC under the video on the right.

{% alert important %}
Make sure to tell your users important things as they come up. Don't wait until the end! Your users will be following along - people don't read instructions _before_ they start the tutorial.
{% endalert %}
