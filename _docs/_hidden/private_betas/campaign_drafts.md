# Saving drafts for campaigns

> As you create and launch campaigns, you can also make edits to an active campaign and save it as a draft, allowing you to pilot your changes prior to another launch.

If you have a campaign that requires large-scale changes, you can create a draft for these edits.

You can create drafts within an active campaign to build, save, and quality-check prior to launching these changes in the active campaign. These drafts don't have any analytics since the draft changes aren't launched yet. A campaign can only have one draft at a time.

To create a draft, do the following:

1. Go to your active campaign.
2. Make your changes.
3. Select the **Save as Draft** button in the campaign footer. Note that edits to the active campaign cannot be made while a draft of a campaign exists. You can update the campaign to apply changes, or discard the draft.

To reference the active campaign, select **View Active Campaign** in the footer from the analytics view or the campaign header from the draft. To return to an active campaign, select **Edit Draft** from the analytics view or the active campaign view.

### In-app message prioritization

In-app message priority will update immediately (before the draft launches) when you select **Set Exact Priority** and specify the priority in relation to other campaigns or Canvases.
