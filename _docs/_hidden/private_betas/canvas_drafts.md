# Saving drafts for Canvas

As you create and launch Canvases, you can also make edits to an active Canvas and save it as a draft, allowing you to pilot your changes prior to another launch. For example, if you have an active Canvas that requires large scale changes, you can use this feature to create separate drafts for these edits.

You can create drafts within an active Canvas to build, save, and quality-check **prior** to launching these changes in the active Canvas.

Saving drafts for Canvas Flow is currently in early access. Contact your Braze customer success manager if you're interested in participating in the early access.
{% endalert %}

To create a draft, go to an active Canvas and click the **Create Draft** button in the Canvas footer. Note that edits to the active Canvas cannot be made while a draft of a Canvas exists. You can launch the draft to apply changes, or discard the draft.

To reference the active Canvas, click **View Active Canvas** in the footer from the analytics view or the Canvas header from the draft. To return to an active Canvas, you can click **Edit Canvas** from the analytics view or the active Canvas view.
