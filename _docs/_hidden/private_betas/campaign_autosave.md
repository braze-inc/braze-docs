# Autosaving campaigns

> As you build your campaigns in Braze, your changes are now automatically saved. This way, you can focus on fine-tuning your campaign details with confidence, knowing that your progress is preserved.

{% alert important %}
Autosave is currently in beta and only available for campaigns. Contact your customer success manager if you're interested in participating in this beta.
{% endalert %}

## How it works

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/campaign_autosave.png %}){: style="float:right;max-width:40%;margin-left:15px;"}

Your campaigns will automatically and periodically save as you edit and switch between tabs in the campaign editor.

Changes are saved as a draft for both draft and active campaigns. For stopped campaigns, your changes will be saved, but the campaign will stay stopped.

If you and another user make changes to a campaign, the first set of changes will be saved. If you're the second person to save changes, you'll need to refresh the page to see the latest updates to the campaign.
