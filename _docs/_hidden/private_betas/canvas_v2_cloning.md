# Cloning Canvases to Canvas V2

Moving to the Canvas V2 workflow includes benefits such as access to lightweight [Canvas components]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components), [persistent entry properties]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/canvas_persistent_entry_properties/), and [post-launch editing]({{site.baseurl}}/post-launch_edits). If you have an existing Canvas you want to move to the V2 workflow, you can clone your Canvas to create a copy of it in the Canvas V2 workflow. When you clone your Canvas to the Canvas V2 workflow, your original Canvas will not be altered or deleted. 

{% alert note %}
You can only clone Canvases with a **Stopped** status. After cloning, the new Canvas V2 will have a **Draft** status. 
{% endalert %}

To clone your Canvas, first go to the Canvas dashboard. Next, identify the Canvas you want to create a copy of in the Canvas V2 workflow. Click <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> **More actions** for the Canvas and select **Clone to V2 Workflow**.

Next, enter the name for your new Canvas and click **Clone to V2 Workflow**. 

![][2]{: style="max-width:70%;"}

Now, you'll have two versions of your Canvas: the original Canvas and the V2 version. Your original Canvas will still have a **Stopped** status, and the cloned Canvas will have a **Draft** status. You can still access the original Canvas, but Braze recommends using the Canvas V2 workflow to continue building your Canvases.

You've completed cloning your Canvas into the Canvas V2 workflow. Now, you can continue building your Canvases in this updated experience!

## Limitations

If your Canvas matches any of the following details, then your Canvas can't be cloned to Canvas V2:

- Status is **Active** 
- Status is **Draft**
- Has Full Steps that have exception events and use the delay filter "in" or "on the next"
- Has a Full Step that branches out into multiple steps, and is not the first step of the Canvas
