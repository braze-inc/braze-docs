# Updated HTML editor for email

> The updated HTML editor for email features a series of UI improvements, including a better code editing experience. 

With the updated HTML editor, you can seamlessly switch between editors (HTML, classic, plaintext, and AMP) with the top editor navigation. These options were previously hidden in a dropdown in the old HTML editor. This updated HTML editor also creates a consistent experience across our editors in other messaging channels, allowing Braze to more efficiently build universal improvements to these editors in the future.

To access the **Link Management** tab in the updated HTML email editor, you must have [link aliasing]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/templates/link_aliasing/) turned on. To turn on link aliasing, contact your account manager.
{% endalert %}

While you can still switch to the old HTML editor by clicking **Switch to old HTML editor**, note that the old HTML editor will be removed in early 2024.
