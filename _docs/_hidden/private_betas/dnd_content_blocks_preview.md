# Preview Drag & Drop Editor Content Blocks

After creating your [Content Blocks for your drag & drop email campaigns]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/drag_and_drop/dnd_content_blocks/), you can now view your library of these Content Blocks within the Drag & Drop Editor.

{% alert important %}
This preview feature for the Drag & Drop Editor Content Blocks is currently in early access. Contact your Braze account manager if you're interested in participating in the early access.
{% endalert %}

To preview your Content Blocks, go to the **Content** section > **Design and Build**. Click the **Rows** tab, and select **Content Blocks** in the dropdown. Here, you can see your Drag & Drop Editor Content Blocks display as they would in your email campaign. 

{% alert note %}
Only Content Blocks used exclusively in the Drag & Drop Editor are viewable under the **Rows** tab.
{% endalert %}

Once you've dragged and dropped the Content Block into your email campaign, you can make changes to any and all content in the Content Block. Note that if a Content Block contains Liquid, you'll see the Liquid in the **Preview & Test** section.
