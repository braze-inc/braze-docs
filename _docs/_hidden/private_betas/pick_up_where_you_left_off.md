You can resume your activities for the following items:

- Canvases
- Campaigns
- Segments

## Key features

### Access most recently edited content

You can revisit recently edited or created campaigns, Canvases, and segments. This way, you can pick up where you left off whenever you return to the Braze dashboard.

### Content type and status tags

Each card is paired with tags that indicate the content type (campaign, Canvas, segment) and status (active, draft, archived, stopped).
