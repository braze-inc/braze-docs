# Commenting in Canvas

Comments in Canvases can be a great collaborative space for your marketing team to identify, discuss, and review the finer details for your Canvases. As you build out a Canvas, you can make and manage comments to identify these areas that may require additional feedback from your colleagues.

## Benefits

Some benefits of commenting in your Canvas include:
- Keeping all details and discussions about a Canvas within a Canvas
- Reviewing edits to a Canvas and encouraging a sign-off process on these changes
- Identifying granular details of a Canvas, such as specific segmentation, including properties and attributes that are unique to a Canvas

## How to comment

In order to leave a comment in a Canvas, you must save a step first. So, when creating a new Canvas, you must first save the Canvas as a draft. Or, as you're adding steps to an existing Canvas, save or update the Canvas to begin commenting.

By default, the sidebar will show open comments. You can toggle to view open comments or all comments by using the <i class="fa-solid fa-sliders"></i> filter icon.

To leave a comment, click the <i class="fas fa-comment"></i> comment icon at the top of the Canvas. This turns your cursor into a comment icon. Click the step you want to comment on. To revert your cursor, press the **Esc** key or click the comment icon again. 

##### Keyboard shortcuts

You can also use keyboard shortcuts to add comments:

| Mac | Windows |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>|
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> | <kbd>Tab</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

To view an existing comment, open the sidebar or select the <i class="fas fa-comment"></i> comment icon next to the step name. You can also reply to existing comments in a thread. 

## Managing comments

You can delete comments and threads you have created by clicking the <i class="fa-solid fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> menu icon in your comment. If a red circle appears next to a comment, this indicates the comment is unread.

You won't be able to delete another user's comments or threads. However, anyone can resolve a comment by selecting **Resolve Thread**. Note that tagging users in comments and notifications for comments are not currently supported.
