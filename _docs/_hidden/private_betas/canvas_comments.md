# Commenting in Canvas

Comments in Canvases can be a great collaborative space for your marketing team to identify, discuss, and review the finer details for your Canvases. As you build out a Canvas, you can make and manage comments to identify these areas that may require additional feedback from your colleagues. 

{% alert important %}
Commenting in Canvas is currently in early access. Contact your Braze account manager if you're interested in participating in this early access.

## Benefits

Some benefits of commenting in your Canvas include:
- Keeping all details and discussions about a Canvas within a Canvas
- Reviewing edits to a Canvas and encouraging a sign-off process on these changes
- Identifying granular details of a Canvas, such as specific segmentation, including properties and attributes that are unique to a Canvas

## How to comment

In order to leave a comment in a Canvas, you must save a step first. So, when creating a new Canvas, you must first save the Canvas as a draft. Or, as you're adding steps to an existing Canvas, save or update the Canvas to begin commenting.

To leave a comment, click the <i class="fas fa-comment"></i> comment icon at the top of the Canvas. This turns your cursor into a comment icon. Click the step you want to comment on. To revert your cursor, press the **Esc** key.

To view an existing comment, open the sidebar or select the <i class="fas fa-comment"></i> comment icon next to the step name. You can also reply to existing comments in a thread. 

## Managing comments

You can delete comments and threads you have created by clicking the <i class="fa-solid fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> menu icon in your comment. You won't be able to delete another user's comments or threads. However, anyone can resolve a comment by selecting **Resolve Thread**.

Note that tagging users in comments and notifications for comments are not currently supported.
