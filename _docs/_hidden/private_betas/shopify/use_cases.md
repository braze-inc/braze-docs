# Shopify use cases

> Interested in seeing how you can leverage your Shopify integration to create timely and effective messaging for your users? Refer to the following sections on common [beginner](#beginner) and [advanced](#advanced) use cases to learn more!

## Beginner

These are some simple yet effective use cases that you can create shortly after setting up Shopify. No additional work is required. 

### Campaigns

These are transactional use cases that allow you to alert your users when there's an update to their Shopify order.

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Refund %}
**Shopify refund event** - `shopify_created_refund`

Users were provided a refund, either partial or complete. This campaign lets the user know that their order was successfully refunded.

![Action-based campaign that enters users who perform the custom event "shopify_created_refund".]({% image_buster /assets/img/Shopify/refund.png %}){: style="max-width:45%;"}

**Messaging example**

![Email with the text "Your order has been refunded, Sorry that you were dissapointed with your order. We've successfully sent your refund. Please wait 3-5 business days for the funds to appear in your statement" and a "View Account" button.]({% image_buster /assets/img/Shopify/refund2.png %}){: style="max-width:80%;border:0;"}
{% endtab %}
{% tab Cancellation %}
**Shopify cancellation event** - `shopify_cancelled_order`

Users were able to cancel their order before fulfillment. This campaign lets the user know that their purchase was successfully canceled.

![Action-based campaign that enters users who perform the custom event "shopify_cancelled_order".]({% image_buster /assets/img/Shopify/cancellation.png %}){: style="max-width:45%;"}

Please wait 3-5 business days for the funds to appear in your statement" and a "View Account" button.]({% image_buster /assets/img/Shopify/cancellation2.png %}){: style="max-width:80%;border:0;"}

{% endtab %}
{% tab Fulfilled order %}
**Shopify fulfilled event** - `shopify_fulfilled_order`

All line items in a user's order were fulfilled successfully. This campaign lets the user know that their entire order was fulfilled.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Partially fulfilled order %}
**Shopify partially fulfilled event** - `shopify_partially_fulfilled_order`

We'll send you another alert when the delivery's been fully complete."]({% image_buster /assets/img/Shopify/partially_fulfilled2.png %}){: style="max-width:40%;border:0;"}

{% endtab %}
{% tab Paid order %}
**Shopify paid order event** - `shopify_paid_order`

User pays for their order, and the order status changes to paid. This campaign lets the user know that their credit card payment was captured or the order was marked as paid if there was a manual payment.

![Action-based campaign that enters users who perform the custom event "shopify_paid_order".]({% image_buster /assets/img/Shopify/paid.png %}){: style="max-width:45%;"}

Then we'll ship it out!" and a "View Account" button.]({% image_buster /assets/img/Shopify/paid2.png %}){: style="max-width:80%;border:0;"}

{% endtab %}
