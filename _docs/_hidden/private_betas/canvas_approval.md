{% alert note %}
Only admins and users with permission to manage approval settings will see this page. Be sure to check that you have the proper [user permissions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/manage_your_braze_users/user_permissions/) to approve Canvases.
{% endalert %}

## Using approvals

In the **Summary** step of the Canvas builder, there is an approval option to approve or deny your key components. The default state for Canvas approval is **Pending Approval**.

Once each section is approved, the **Launch** button will be available, and you can launch your Canvas.
