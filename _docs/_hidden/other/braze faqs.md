# Braze FAQs

Appboy has become Braze. The word Braze means to bond, to unite, or to join with considerable strength. Renaming our company to Braze is a representation of the strong, unwavering connection that our technology creates between people and the brands they love.

As we move over to Braze, you have questions–and we have answers. Check out the following FAQs.

### Is the dashboard going to look different?
Yes! On Thursday, November 16, we shared our new visual brand identity and new dashboard interface.

### Do I need to change my SDK integration?
You do not need to make any changes to your SDK integration now. However, you will need to make an update to the SDK endpoint used by your apps by June 1, 2019. We will be emailing more details about this in the months ahead, as well as updating our [documentation][1], and will ensure that you are notified.

### Are my API endpoints changing?
You do not need to make any changes to your REST API integrations now. However, you will need to make an update to the REST API endpoints used by your integration by June 1, 2019. We will be providing more information on the new API endpoints you should use in the months ahead, as well as updating our [documentation][1], and will ensure that you are notified.

### Do I have to log into the new braze.com dashboard URL from now on?
**Yes.** We have changed over to braze.com URLs. Your appboy.com login URL will automatically redirect to the braze.com login page, and old appboy.com URLs will continue to work through 2018.

### Is my login changing?
**No.** Your login credentials will not change. You’ll be able to log in to the Braze dashboard using your same email and password.

### Do I need a new contract?
**No.** Appboy and Braze are one and the same company. This is just a name change (a rose by any other name…). Your existing contract is still fully enforceable and you do not have to do anything.

### My legal team wants evidence that you have legally changed your name. Can I get that?
**Yes.** You can ask your account manager, your customer success manager, or email `generalcounsel@braze.com`.

### Does this mean you've been acquired?
**No.** Braze is the same company owned by the same people providing the same Services.  Our new name better reflects who we are and what we do.

### Where do I go for support?
Contact your customer success manager or open a [support ticket][support].

### If I email Appboy, will it bounce?
**No.** Every `appboy.com` email address will get mapped to a new `braze.com` email address.
