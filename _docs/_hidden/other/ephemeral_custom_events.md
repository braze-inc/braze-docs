# Ephemeral Custom Events

- Ephemeral Custom Events shall not include Purchase Events or Start Session and End Session (as described in the Braze Documentation).
- Braze will not transmit and store the Custom Events as Data Points in Braze for up to 12 placements/ event names per SDK Implementation.
- The Ephemeral Events solution will be rolled into Braze’s production iOS and Android SDKs, and into any future Braze production SDKs for platforms for which Braze has enabled the Ephemeral Custom Events solution. This ensures that Customer can use such production SDKs and will not be out of sync with future features and bug fixes. This also ensures that Customer can take advantage of future SDK updates without the need for other custom processes.
