# WhatsApp Credit Ratios

> **WhatsApp** is a channel focused on 2-way messaging and thus anchors on conversations (instead of number of individual messages). A conversation is a 24-hour thread between a business and an end-user. The number of individual messages within a conversation does not impact credits usage. 

**User-initiated Conversations**: End-user sends a message to the business. When the business sends a message in response, this begins the 24-hour window.

**Business-initiated Conversations**: Business starts by sending an approved template message to the customer. As soon as the business sends a message it begins the 24-hour window.

**Credit Ratios**: The following credit ratios determine how many credits it takes to initiate one conversation, as of March 15, 2023. 

For example, 1 Argentina business-initiated conversation will use up 14 WhatsApp credits.

Credit ratios may be subject to change as indicated in the WhatsApp channel product specific terms between Braze and the applicable customer.
