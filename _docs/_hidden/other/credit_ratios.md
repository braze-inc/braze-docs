# WhatsApp Credit Ratios (Confidential)

> **WhatsApp** is a channel focused on 2-way messaging and thus anchors on conversations (instead of number of individual messages). A conversation is a 24-hour thread between a business and an end-user. The number of individual messages within a conversation does not impact credit usage. 

{% alert note %}
In anticipation of Meta's upcoming changes to its WhatsApp pricing tables, which come into effect on June 1, 2023, Braze has included two credit ratio tables below for visibility. The first table reflects the credit ratios that are available to customers between March 15, 2023, to May 31, 2023, and the second table reflects the credit ratios that will be available to customers as of June 1, 2023.<br><br>
As of June 1, 2023, note that the amount of credits a customer will need to send messages via Braze's native support of WhatsApp may differ from the amount required during March-May 2023.<br><br>
In the event that Meta modifies its pricing or packaging for WhatsApp, Braze reserves the right to modify its credit ratios accordingly upon reasonable notice.

#### March 2023 - May 2023

**User-initiated Conversations**: End-user sends a message to the business. When the business sends a message in response, this begins the 24-hour window.

**Business-initiated Conversations**: Business starts by sending an approved template message to the customer. As soon as the business sends a message, it begins the 24-hour window.

**Credit Ratios**: The following credit ratios determine how many credits it takes to initiate one conversation as of March 15, 2023. 
- For example, 1 Argentina business-initiated conversation will use up 14 WhatsApp credits.

#### Beginning on June 1, 2023

**Marketing Conversations**: Include promotions or offers, informational updates, or invitations for customers to respond or take action. 

**Utility Conversations**: Facilitate a specific, agreed-upon request or transaction or update to a customer about an ongoing transaction, including post-purchase notifications and recurring billing statements.

**Service Conversations**: End-user sends a message to the business. When the business sends a message in response, this begins the 24hr window.

**Authentication Conversations**: Enable businesses to authenticate users with one-time passcodes, potentially at multiple steps in the login process (e.g., account verification, account recovery, integrity challenges) 
  - Authentication conversations will only be supported on a case-by-case basis and Braze cannot guarantee specific SLAs. Additionally, Braze does not support pin generation.
