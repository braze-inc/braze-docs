## Integration

To integrate with MyPostcard, [log in or sign up][2] and create your first campaign to use it through [Braze webhooks][3].

### Step 1: Create your Braze webhook template

Create a MyPostcard webhook template to use in future campaigns or Canvases by navigating to **Templates** > **Webhook Templates** in the Braze platform.

{% alert note %}
If you are using the [older navigation]({{site.baseurl}}/navigation/), go to **Engagement** > **Templates & Media** > **Webhook Templates**.
{% endalert %}

If you would like to create a one-off MyPostcard webhook campaign or use an existing template, select **Webhook** in Braze when creating a new campaign. Fill out the following fields:

| Field         | Description                                               |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Webhook URL** | The webhook URL as shown in the B2B Admin Tool.             |
| **Request Body** | Raw Text (JSON format found in the B2B Admin Tool).        |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation" }

#### Request method and headers

MyPostcard requires an HTTP method along with the following HTTP headers to be included in the template.

{% raw %}
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Field</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Details</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>HTTP Method</strong></td>
      <td><code>POST</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Username</strong></td>
      <td><code>{{ '&lt;username&gt;' }}</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Password</strong></td>
      <td><code>{{ '&lt;password&gt;' }}</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Content-Type</strong></td>
      <td><code>application/json</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
{% endraw %}
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation" }

#### Request body

Copy the request body displayed in the B2B Admin Tool, then fill in the placeholders with content using any Liquid personalization tags.
