# Zendesk Chat

> [Zendesk Chat](https://www.zendesk.com/service/messaging/) uses webhooks from each platform to set up a two-way SMS conversation. When a user requests support, a ticket is created in Zendesk. Agent responses are forwarded to Braze through an API-triggered SMS campaign, and user replies are sent back to Zendesk.

## Prerequisites


| Prerequisite | Description |
|---|---|
| A Zendesk account | A Zendesk account is required to take advantage of this partnership.|
| A Zendesk Basic Authorization Token | A Zendesk Basic Authorization Token will be used to make an outbound webhook request from Braze to Zendesk.|
| A Braze REST API Key  | A Braze REST API key with `campaigns.trigger.send` permissions. This can be created in the Braze dashboard from **Settings** > **API Keys**.|

## Use cases

Enhance customer support efficiency by combining Braze SMS capabilities with Zendesk live agent responses to address user inquiries with human support promptly.

## Integrating Zendesk Chat

### Step 1: Create a webhook in Zendesk

1. In the Zendesk developer console, go to webhooks: {% raw %}`https://{{url}}.zendesk.com/admin/apps-integrations/webhooks/webhooks`{% endraw %}
2. Under **Create Webhook**, select **Trigger or automation**.
3. For **Endpoint URL**, add the **/campaign/trigger/send** endpoint.
4. Under **Authentication**, select **Bearer token** and add the Braze REST API key with `campaigns.trigger.send` permissions.

### Step 2: Create an outbound SMS campaign

Next, you’ll create an SMS campaign that will listen for webhooks from Zendesk and send a custom SMS response to your customers.

#### Step 2.1: Compose your message

When Zendesk sends the content of a message through the API, it comes in the following format:

```
**----------------------------------------------\n\n{Replier Name}, {Replier Date}\n\n{Message}**
```

So we need to extract the detail we want from this string to display in the message, or else a user will see all the details.

![An example SMS without formatting.][2]{: style="max-width:40%;"}

In the **Message** textbox, add the following Liquid code and any opt-out language or other static content:

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% assign body = {{api_trigger_properties.${msg_body}}} %}
{% assign msg = body | split: "
" %}
New message from Zendesk: 
{{msg[2]}}
 
Feel free to respond directly to this number!
```
{% endraw %}

![An example SMS with formatting.][3]{: style="max-width:70%;"}

#### Step 2.2: Schedule the delivery

For the delivery type, select **API-Triggered delivery**, then copy the Campaign ID which will be used in the next steps.

![API Triggered delivery][4]{: style="max-width:70%;"}

Finally, under **Delivery Controls**, turn on re-eligibility.

![Re-eligibility enabled under "Delivery Controls."][5]

### Step 3: Create a trigger in Zendesk to forward agent replies to Braze

Go to **Objects and rules** > **Business rules** > **Triggers**.

1. Create a new **category** (for example, **Trigger a message**).
2. Create a new **trigger** (for example, **Respond via SMS Braze**).
3. Under **Conditions**, select:
- **Ticket>Comment** is **Present and requester can see comment** so that the message is triggered whenever a new public comment is included in a ticket update
- **Ticket>Update** *is not* **Web service (API)** so that when a user sends a message from Braze, it isn't forwarded back to their cell phone. Only messages coming from Zendesk will be forwarded.

![Respond via SMS Braze.][6]{: style="max-width:70%;"}

Under **Actions**, select **Notify by Webhook** and choose the endpoint you created in step 1. Next, specify the body of the API call. Enter the `campaign_id` from [step 2.2](#step-22-schedule-the-delivery) into the request body.

![Respond via SMS Braze JSON body.][7]{: style="max-width:70%;"}

{% raw %}
```liquid
{
    "campaign_id": "{{YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID}}",
    "recipients": [
        {
            "external_user_id": "{{ticket.requester.custom_fields.braze_external_id}}",
			"trigger_properties": {
    "msg_body": "{{ticket.latest_public_comment_html}}"
		},
		"attributes": {
        "zendesk_ticket" : "{{ticket.id}}",
	"zendesk_ticket_open" : "true"
    }
        }
    ]
}
```
{% endraw %}


### Step 4: Create a trigger in Zendesk to update a user when a ticket is closed

If you’d like to notify the user that the ticket has been closed, create a new campaign in Braze with the templated response body.

![Update a user when ticket is closed.][8]{: style="max-width:70%;"}

Select **API Triggered delivery**, and copy the campaign ID.

Next, set up a trigger to notify Braze when the ticket is closed:
- Category: **Trigger a message**
- Under Conditions, select **Ticket>Ticket Status** and change it to **Solved**

![Solved ticket set up in Zendesk.][9]{: style="max-width:70%;"}

Under **Actions**, select **Notify by Webhook** and choose the second endpoint you just created. From there, we need to specify the body of the API call:

![Solved ticket JSON body.][10]{: style="max-width:70%;"}

{% raw %}
```liquid
{
    "campaign_id": "{{YOUR_API_KEY}}",
    "recipients": [
        {
            "external_user_id": "{{ticket.requester.custom_fields.braze_external_id}}",
"trigger_properties": {
    "msg_body": "Your ticket has been closed"
		},
,
			"attributes": {
	"zendesk_ticket_open" : "false"
    }
        }
    ]
}
```
{% endraw %}

### Step 5: Add a custom user field in Zendesk

In the Admin Center, select **People** in the sidebar, then select **Configuration** > **User fields**. Add the custom user field `braze_external_id`.

### Step 6: Set up inbound-SMS forwarding

Next, you’ll create two new webhook campaigns in Braze so you can forward inbound SMS from customers to the Zendesk inbox.

| Campaign           | Purpose                                                                              |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Webhook campaign 1 | Creates a new ticket in Zendesk.                                                     |
| Webhook campaign 2 | Forwards all conversational SMS responses sent inbound from the customer to Zendesk. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 }

#### Step 6.1: Create an SMS keyword category

In the Braze dashboard, go to **Audience**, choose your **SMS subscription group**, then select **Add Custom Keyword**. Fill out the following fields to create an exclusive SMS keyword category for Zendesk.

| Field            | Description                                                                                                               |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Keyword Category | The name of your keyword category, such as `ZendeskSMS1`.                                                                 |
| Keywords         | Your custom keywords, such as `SUPPORT`.                                                                                  |
| Reply Message    | The message that will be sent when a keyword is detected, such as "A customer service rep will reach out to you shortly." |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 }

![An example SMS keyword category in Braze.][11]{: style="max-width:70%;"}

#### Step 6.2: Create your first webhook campaign

In the Braze dashboard, create your first webhook campaign. This message will signal to Zendesk that support is being requested.

In the webhook composer, fill out the following fields:
- Webhook URL: {% raw %}https://{{url}}.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets{% endraw %}
- HTTP Method: POST
- Request Headers:
- Content-Type: application/json
- Authorization:  Basic {{Token}}
- Request body: 

{% raw %}
```liquid
{
  "ticket": {
    "subject": "Action Needed",
    "comment": {
      "body": "{{sms.${inbound_message_body}}}"
    },
"requester":{
"name": "{{${first_name}}} {{${last_name}}}",
"user_fields": {
"braze_external_id": "{{${user_id}}}"
}
},
    "priority": "normal",
    "type": "problem"
  }
}
```
{% endraw %}

![An example request with the two required headers.][12]{: style="max-width:70%;"}


#### Step 6.3: Schedule the first delivery

For **Schedule Delivery**, select **Action-Based Delivery**, then choose **Send an SMS Inbound Message** for your trigger type. Also add the SMS subscription group and keyword category you set up previously.

![The "Schedule Delivery" page for the first webhook campaign.][13]

Under **Delivery Controls**, turn on re-eligibility.

![Re-eligibility selected under "Delivery Controls" for the first webhook campaign.][14]

#### Step 6.4: Create your second webhook campaign

Set up a webhook campaign to forward remaining SMS messages from the user to Zendesk:

Because Zendesk sends the ticket ID as a string, create a Content Block to convert the string to an integer so you can use it in Zendesk’s webhook.

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% assign var = {{custom_attribute.${zendesk_ticket}}} | to_i %}{{var}}
```
{% endraw %}

In the webhook composer:
- Webhook URL: {% raw %}https://{{url}}.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/{{content_blocks.${to_int}}}.json{% endraw %}
- Request: PUT
- KVPs:
    - Content-Type:application/JSON
    - Authorization: Basic {{Token}}

Sample Body: 

{% raw %}
```liquid
{
  "ticket": {
    "comment": {
      "body": "Inbound message from {{${first_name}}} {{${last_name}}}: {{sms.${inbound_message_body}}}"
    }
}
}
```
{% endraw %}

#### Step 6.5: Complete second webhook campaign setup
- Set up an action-based trigger for users who send an inbound message in the category "Other".
- Set up re-eligibility criteria.
- Add applicable audiences (in this case, the custom attribute **zendesk_ticket_open** is **true**).
