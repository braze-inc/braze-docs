## About the integration

The Braze and Komo integration allows you to gather first and zero-party data through Komo Engagement Hubs. These hubs are dynamic microsites that offer interactive content and gamification features. The user data collected from these hubs are then transmitted to the Braze API.

- Ingest first and zero-party user data gather from Komo to Braze in real-time
- Ingest market research and user preference data when they answer surveys, polls, and quiz questions
- Progressively build user profiles in Braze over time as the user continues to engage and share more data about themselves
- Standardize the look and feel of transactional emails sent through Braze

## Use cases

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Data Capture - Form Submission %}

When a user submits a customizable data capture form in Komo, the Komo fields mapped in the Braze integration will be passed to Braze via the `/users/track/` API call.

Data capture forms exist either at the start or end of Cards.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Market Research - Coming soon %}

Komo also enables the ability to pass through market research data captured when a user answers a quiz question, poll, personality test, swiper, etc. This data will enable you to enhance a user's profile beyond data captured in form submissions.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Integration

### Step 1: Publish a Komo Engagement Hub and card

You will need to publish a Komo Hub with at least one card containing a data capture form. When published, you can test the user experience end-to-end and verify the integration is working correctly.

#### Configure the integration via a Workflow

Now you need to setup a workflow, within a Workspace, Site or Card, to sync data to Braze. 

Whether you scope the workflow within the scope of the netire Workspace, a Site (which contains many Cards) or a single Card, is just dependent on whether you want the workflow to trigger across many Cards or campaigns. 

Once you've created a Workflow, define your trigger, search for Braze in the step menu and add the "Track User" step.

From here, you can simply configure the events, attributions and subscriptions you want to sync from Komo to Braze.
