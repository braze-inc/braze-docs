# API partner integration

> Learn about the requirements for partner API integrations, such as the syntax for `User-Agent` headers.

{% alert important %}
Previously, partners were required to add their name to the partner field in their API Requests. This formatting is no longer supported and a `User-Agent` header is now required.
{% endalert %}

## User agents

You are required to include a `User-Agent` header that clearly identifies the source of the traffic. This enables our shared customers to see partner traffic in Brazeâ€™s API usage reporting, and enables Braze engineers to identify integrations that are not following best practices. Generally, you should only use a single user agent for all of your traffic.

### Syntax

Your `User-Agent` header must adhere to the following format (which is similar to the [RFC 7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#page-46) standard):

```bash
User-Agent: partner-OrganizationName-ProductName/ProductVersion
```

Replace the following:

| Placeholder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `OrganizationName` | The name of your organization formatted in Pascal case. |
| `ProductName` | The name of the your product formatted in Pascal case. |
| `ProductVersion` | The version number of your product. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation" }

### Examples

For example, the following would be a correct user agent for Snowflake's Cloud Data Ingestion:

```bash
User-Agent: partner-Snowflake-CloudDataIngestion/179
```

Whereas this would be incorrect because it doesn't clearly identify the source of the traffic:

```bash
User-Agent: axios/1.4.0
```
