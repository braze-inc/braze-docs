# API partner integration

## User Agents

All partners are required to include a User-Agent header which clearly identifies the source of the traffic. This enables our shared customers to see partner traffic in Brazeâ€™s API usage reporting, and enables Braze engineers to identify integrations which are not following best practices. Partners should generally only use a single user agent for all their traffic.

User agents should follow the following format which clearly identifies the partner, similar to [RFC 7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#page-46):

```
User-Agent: partner-NAME-PRODUCT/VERSION
```

Replace the following:

| Placeholder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `NAME` | The name of your organization in pascal case. |
| `PRODUCT` | The name of the specific product in pascal case. |
| `VERSION` | The version number of the product. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation" }

For example, a correct user agent for Snowflake Cloud Data Ingestion would be:

```
User-Agent: partner-Snowflake-CloudDataIngestion/179
```

Whereas this is an incorrect user agent because it doesn't clearly identify the source of the traffic:

```
User-Agent: axios/1.4.0
```
