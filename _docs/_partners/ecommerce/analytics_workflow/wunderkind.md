## Integration

Contact your WunderKind team to help set up the integration. You will be asked to provide your Braze ESP or API credentials so that Wunderkind can send out email deployments and subscription statuses through the API. 

Once connected, Wunderkind will:
- Conduct preliminary testing to confirm a stable connection and ensure emails can deploy from the Wunderkind side to the ESP. 
- Create individual campaigns within the Braze UI for each part of a series to allow the rendered emails to be sent.
- Develop the integration for sending rendered email content in real-time through Braze using the appropriate API endpoint.
- Conduct extensive quality assurance in a testing environment to ensure emails pass through correctly and data flows into Braze as anticipated.
