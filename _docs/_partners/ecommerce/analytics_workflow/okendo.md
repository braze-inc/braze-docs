## About the integration

## Integration

### Step 1: Set up Braze Connector in Okendo

1. In Okendo, go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Email & SMS** > **Braze**
2. Add the API endpoint and API key to the **Integration** settings.

### Step 2: Configure your identifier

The `external_id` field is used to identify the user associated with each event. Toggle on **Use Shopify Customer ID for Braze user identification** to associate the field with Shopify Customer IDs. Otherwise, toggle it off to associate it with each user's email address.
