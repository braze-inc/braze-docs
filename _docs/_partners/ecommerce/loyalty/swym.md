# Swym

> [Swym](https://getswym.com/) helps eCommerce brands capture shopping intent with Wishlists, Save for Later, Gift Registry, and Back-in-Stock alerts. Using rich, permission-based data, you can craft hyper-targeted campaigns and deliver personalized shopping experiences that drive engagement, boost conversions, and increase loyalty.

*This integration is maintained by Swym.*

## About the integration

The Swym and Braze integration empowers you to deliver highly personalized, event-driven marketing campaigns that convert shopper intent into sales. Use the integration to make it easy for shoppers to pick up where they left off, to collaborate with others throughout their shopping journey, and to deploy high-performance retargeting campaigns.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you'll need the following:

| Prerequisite          | Description                                                                                                                                |

## Use cases

By connecting Swym’s Wishlist Plus and Back in Stock Alerts apps with Braze, you can automatically send shopper activity events, such as wishlist adds, back-in-stock subscriptions, price drop alerts, and reminders, into Braze as custom events. These events can then be used to trigger automated messages in Braze, facilitating timely, relevant, and engaging communication that brings shoppers back to make a purchase.

## Integrating Swym

### Step 1: Connect your Swym app to Braze

Currently, the Braze integration with Swym is a managed integration and is not self-serve. To get started, contact the Swym support team at [support@getswym.com](mailto:support@getswym.com) and provide the following information so that Swym can set up the integration on your behalf:

1. Generate a [REST API key]({{site.baseurl}}/api/basics/#about-rest-api-keys) in your Braze dashboard with the `users.track` permission.

![Generating an API key in Braze.]({% image_buster /assets/img/swym/braze-api-key.png %})

{% alert important %}
Share credentials securely using [OneTimeSecret](https://onetimesecret.com/) (a one-time, self-destructive link tool) to keep your API keys protected.
{% endalert %}

{: start="2"}
2. Braze manages multiple instances for its dashboard and REST endpoints. Provide the [REST endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/basics/#endpoints) for the instance you are provisioned.

3. After the API key and instance URL are shared with the Swym support team, they will set up the integration for you and respond with a confirmation.

4. After setup is completed, the custom events from Swym will be automatically registered in Braze. You can view the list of registered Swym events in the Braze dashboard by going to **Data Settings** > **Custom Events**. 

5. View the properties of each Swym event by selecting **Manage Properties** for the corresponding custom event. These properties contain the event values that can be used to personalize your messages.

### Step 2: Subscribe to events you want to send to Braze

From your Wishlist Plus app, go to the **Marketing** tab and find the **Automations** section. Here, you can select the events you want to subscribe to.

{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation"}

#### Swym Back in Stock Alerts app events

{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation"}

### Step 3: Create a Braze campaign or Canvas

To automate the delivery of personalized messages for your shoppers, you must create a separate campaign or Canvas in Braze for each event you subscribed to. Each campaign or Canvas should be configured to trigger based on the specific event and use the corresponding event properties to populate dynamic content in your messages. For step-by-step guidance, you can refer to [Getting Started: Campaigns and Canvases]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/getting_started/campaigns_canvases/).
