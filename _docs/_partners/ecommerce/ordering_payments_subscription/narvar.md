# Narvar

## Integration Details

For each notification event, Narvar initiates a request to Braze’s [`/messaging/send`]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/messaging) endpoint to deliver a push message to each opted-in consumer.

Narvar is responsible for configuring the push notification payloads for each message. Currently, Narvar does not have a built-in design interface for push notifications, so their team will collaborate with your team to determine and define payload requirements. These payloads can be customized to the same extent as those sent through your own system, including support for variable content placeholders, such as order data and consumer details.

## Getting Started with the Braze-Narvar Integration

1. **Contact your Narvar CSM** to express interest in the integration.
2. **Designate Braze environments** for staging and production.
3. **Generate API Key** in Braze for Narvar’s use.
4. **Generate Campaign Key(s)** in Braze as needed.
5. **Provide API and Campaign keys** to Narvar through a secure one-time link.
6. **Share Push Notification Payload Details** to finalize setup.
