## Integration

## Step 1: Phrase TMS Settings

In Phrase, navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Connectors > New**.

1. Provide a name for the connection and change the type to **Braze**.<br><br>
2. Enter the REST API key and the Braze REST endpoint. <br><br>
3. Select how the connector should import email templates with linked Content Blocks. 
- Selected email template only
- Include Content Blocks<br><br>
4. Select how the connector should export email template translations. 
- Create new item
- Original item
  - Original item exports translations to the same template/block. Language segments are defined by the provided attribute.<br><br>
    {% raw %}
    Provide the language attribute if original item is selected. The language attribute defines the language of the if/elsif argument. If you are using the original item option, it must be structured as shown below:

    ```liquid
    {% if {{custom_attribute.${attribute_name}}} == 'da-DK' %}
    danish content
    {% elsif {{custom_attribute.${attribute_name}}} == 'pt-PT' %}
    portuguese content
    {% elsif {{custom_attribute.${attribute_name}}} == 'sv-SE' %}
    swedish content
    {% else %}
    Original content
    {% endif %}
    ```
    Or using the assign keys/values mapping:
    ```liquid
    {% if {{custom_attribute.${attribute_name}}} == 'da-DK' %}
      {% assign abc_key1 = "danish_value1" %}
    {% elsif {{custom_attribute.${attribute_name}}} == 'pt-PT' %}
      {% assign abc_key = "portuguese value" %}
    {% elsif {{custom_attribute.${attribute_name}}} == 'sv-SE' %}
      {% assign abc_key = "swedish value" %}
    {% else %}
      {% assign abc_key = "Source language value" %}
    {% endif %}
    ```
    The above Liquid must be strictly followed, but the language attribute and language, keys, and value are adjustable.<br><br>
    Each language code can only be used once, However, multiple languages can be used for one segment, for example:
    ```liquid
    {% elsif {{custom_attribute.${attribute_name}}} == 'de-DE' or {{custom_attribute.${attribute_name}}} == 'de-AT' or {{custom_attribute.${attribute_name}}} == 'de-CH' %}
    {% endraw %}
    ```
5. Click **Test connection**. A checkmark will appear if the connection is successful. Hover over the icon to see additional details.<br><br>
7. Lastly, click **Save**. This connector will be available on the **Connectors** page.

## Step 3: Send content to Phrase and export back to Braze

1. First, set up the [submitter portal](https://support.phrase.com/hc/en-us/articles/5709602111132) to allow submitters to add files to requests directly from the online repository.<br><br>
2. Use [Automated Project Creation (APC)](https://support.phrase.com/hc/en-us/articles/5709647363356) to have Phrase TMS automatically create new projects when a change in the specified workflow states is detected.<br><br>
3. Selected content items are imported the very first time APC runs.

The [Connector API](https://cloud.memsource.com/web/docs/api#) can automate steps otherwise performed manually through the UI. [Webhooks](https://support.phrase.com/hc/en-us/articles/5709693398812) can be used to have Phrase TMS notify 3rd party systems about certain events (for example, a job status change).
