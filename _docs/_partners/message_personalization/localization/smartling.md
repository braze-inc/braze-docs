### Step 1: Set up the Braze project in Smartling TMS

#### Connecting Braze to Smartling

1. In [Smartling](https://dashboard.smartling.com/), create a [Braze Connector](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003074093) project type in your Smartling account. 
  - Ensure all required target languages are added to the project.
2. From within this project, click **Settings** > **Braze Settings** > **Connect to Braze**.
3. Enter your Braze API URL and Braze API key.
4. Click **Save**.

#### Complete Braze connector configuration

Refer to Smartling [documentation](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/13248549217435) for details on connector configuration.

Select how you want automation of prior requests for translation.

Configure the source and target languages in **Language Configuration**. It will be used by the connector for ingesting content into Smartling TMS and delivering translations back to Braze.
