The Smartling Braze integration allows you to translate HTML email templates, Content Blocks, Canvases, and campaign email messages. Note the following details depending on what you're translating:

**Email templates**
* Only HTML email templates are supported.
* You will need to decide on how your translated emails are delivered to Braze by the connector:
  * **One Email for All Languages:** The connector delivers all languages in the same email as the source.
  * **One Email per Language:** The connector creates a new email for each language in Braze.

**Content Blocks**
* All Content Blocks are supported.
* The Content Blocks contain both the original and translated versions.
* Liquid script determines the correct language for display based on the recipient's language preference.

**Campaigns and Canvases**
* Make sure you've added your target languages under **Multi-Language Support** settings in Braze.
* Refer to [Smartling documentation][3] for details on connector configuration.
