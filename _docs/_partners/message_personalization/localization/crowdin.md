# Crowdin

> Crowdin is a cloud-based software for localization management. Braze integration with Crowdin allows you to translate email templates and content blocks. You can synchronize content from your Braze account to your Crowdin project and add translations back to Braze.

Using Crowdin, you can translate your Android and iOS apps, website, store screenshots, and other content. Use features for improving translation quality, adding translation context, team cooperation, translation memory, workflow automation, integrations and plugins, and much more. You can translate your content with your in-house team, a translation agency, or using machine translation engines.

## Prerequisites

To connect your Braze account with <a href="https://accounts.crowdin.com/register" target="_blank">Crowdin</a> or <a href="https://accounts.crowdin.com/register" target="_blank">Crowdin Enterprise</a>, you’ll first need to sign up and create your translation project.

## Generate your credentials in Braze

To connect your Braze account with Crowdin, you need to provide two authorization elements: 
* Braze REST API Key 
* Braze REST Endpoint

### Create Braze REST API Key

To create a new Braze REST API Key in your Braze account, follow these steps:

1. In your Braze Dashboard, navigate to __Developer Console__ under __Settings__.
2. Click __Create New API Key__ in the REST API Keys section.
3. Specify your API Key Name and select the following permissions:
- Templates
- Content Blocks<br>
These permissions represent the content types you’ll be able to transfer to Crowdin for localization.<br>
4. Click __Save API key__.

After this, you’ll see your new REST API Key in the REST API Keys section list. Copy your new REST API Key from the Identifier column.<br><br>![Copy REST API Key Identifier][1]

### Copy Braze REST Endpoint

Depending on the instance your Braze account is provisioned to, copy the respective Braze REST Endpoint from the <a href="https://www.braze.com/docs/api/basics/#endpoints" target="_blank">Endpoints table</a>.

For example, if your Braze account is provisioned to the instance **US-01**, your Braze REST Endpoint is the following:<br> `rest.iad-01.braze.com`
