# Radar

> [Radar](https://www.onradar.com/) is a geofencing platform for mobile and web apps. Combining Braze's industry-leading engagement platform and Radar's industry-leading geofencing capabilities allows you to drive digital engagement and loyalty. 
The Radar platform has three products: [Geofences](https://radar.io/product/geofencing), [Trip Tracking](https://radar.io/product/trip-tracking), and [Geo APIs](https://radar.io/product/api).

Use the Radar and Braze integration to add location context and tracking to your iOS and Android apps in less than ten lines of code, allowing you to easily retarget your customers and augment your marketing with rich location data. Whenever Radar geofence or trip tracking events are generated, Radar will send custom events and user attributes to Braze. You can use these events and attributes to build location-based segments or trigger location-based campaigns.

Additionally, Radar Geo APIs can be leveraged to enrich or personalize your marketing campaigns through [Connected Content]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/connected_content/about_connected_content/). 

## Event Integration Details

To map data between the Braze and Radar SDKs, you will need to set the same user IDs in both systems. This can be done by using the `changeUser()` method in the Braze SDK and the `setUserId()` method in the Radar SDK.

To enable the integration:
1. Visit the Braze __Developer Console__ page and copy your group identifier
2. On the Braze __Manage Settings__ page, copy your iOS API keys and Android API keys.
3. On the Radar [Integrations page](https://www.onradar.com/integrations) under Braze:
	- Set __Enabled__ to __Yes__
	- Set your Braze endpoint
	- Paste in your group identifier and API keys
	- Input any event or event attribute filtering to ensure only relevant data is sent to Braze for engagement marketing

You can set separate API keys for the test and live environments.
{% endalert %}

Whenever Radar events are generated, Radar will send custom events and user attributes to Braze. Events from iOS devices will be sent using your iOS API keys; events and user attributes from Android devices will be sent using your Android API keys.

## Event and Attribute-Based Use Cases

You can use custom events and user attributes to build location-based segments or trigger location-based campaigns.

## Connected Content

The following example shows how to run a promotion to drive nearby users in-store with a digital offer. 

![Connected Content Example][1]{: style="float:right;max-width:30%;border:0;"}

To get started, you'll need to have your Radar publishable API key on hand to use within your request URLs.

Next, within a `connected_content` tag, make a GET request to the [Search Places API](https://radar.io/documentation/api#search-places). The search places API returns nearby locations based on [Radar Places](https://radar.io/documentation/places): a database of locations for places, chains, and categories that provides a comprehensive view of the world.

Shown below is an example of what Radar will return as a JSON object from the API call:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "code": 200
  },
  "places": [
    {
      "_id": "5dc9b0fd2004860034bf2b06",
      "name": "Target",
      "location": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
          -74.42653983613333,
          40.548302893822985
        ]
      },
      "categories": [
        "shopping-retail",
        "department-store"
      ],
      "chain": {
        "slug": "target",
        "name": "Target",
        "domain": "target.com"
      }
    },
    {
      "_id": "5dc9b3d82004860034bfec54",
      "name": "Walmart",
      "location": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
          -74.44121885326864,
          40.554603296187224
        ]
      },
      "categories": [
        "shopping-retail"
      ],
      "chain": {
        "slug": "walmart",
        "name": "Walmart",
        "domain": "walmart.com"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

To construct the Connected Content targeted and personalized Braze message, you can leverage the Braze `most_recent_location` attribute as an input for the `near` parameter in the API request's URL. The `most_recent_location` attribute is collected via the Radar event integration or directly through the Braze SDK.

In the example below, the Radar chain filtering is applied for Target and Walmart locations, and the radius of the search for nearby locations is set to 2 km.

{% raw %}
```
{% connected_content https://api.radar.io/v1/search/places?radius=2000&near={{${most_recent_location}.latitude}},{{${most_recent_location}.longitude}}&chains=target,walmart&limit=5 :method get :headers {"Authorization": "<yourRadarPublishableKey>"} :content_type application/json :save nearbyplaces %}
```
{% endraw %}

As you can see from the `connect_content` tag above, we stored the JSON object into the local variable `nearbyplaces` by adding `:save nearbyplaces` after the URL.
You can test what the output should be by referencing {% raw %}`{{nearbyplaces.places}}`{% endraw%}.

Bringing our use-case together, here is what the syntax of the campaign would look like. The code below iterates through the `nearbyplaces.places` object, extracting unique values and concatenating them with proper human-readable delimiters for the message.

{% raw %}
```
{% connected_content https://api.radar.io/v1/search/places?radius=2000&near={{${most_recent_location}.latitude}},{{${most_recent_location}.longitude}}&chains=target,walmart&limit=5 :method get :headers {"Authorization": "<yourRadarPublishableKey>"} :content_type application/json :save nearbyplaces %}
{% if nearbyplaces.__http_status_code__ != 200 %}
{% abort_message('Connected Content returned a non-200 http status code') %}
{% endif %}
{% if nearbyplaces.meta.code != 200 %}
{% abort_message('Connected Content returned a non-200 meta code') %}
{% endif %}
{% if nearbyplaces.places.size == 0 %}
{% abort_message('Connected Content returned no nearby places') %}
{% else %}
{% assign delimiter = ", " %}
{% assign names = nearbyplaces.places | map: 'name' | uniq %}
{% if names.size == 2 %}
{{ names | join: ' and ' }} 
{% elsif names.size > 2 %}
{% assign names_final_str = "" %}
{% for name in names %}
{% if forloop.first == true %}
{% assign names_final_str = names_final_str  | append: name %}
{% elsif forloop.last == true %}
{% assign names_final_str = names_final_str | append: ", and "  | append: name %}
{% else %}
{% assign names_final_str = names_final_str | append: delimiter  | append: name %}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{{ names_final_str }}
{% else %}
{{ names }} 
{% endif %}
near you!
```
{% endraw %}
