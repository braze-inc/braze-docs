## Integration

Use [LiftIgniter's REST API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2166502/liftigniter/7TFGvSV#9bdf75da-edd6-45ec-9c28-a0edefad1389) to insert personalized content into your messages. Once you have your LiftIgniter account and LiftIgniter is integrated into your app, add the following template into your message composer to call content into your messages, replacing information as needed (`x-api-key`, `theapikey`, etc.).

{% raw %}
```
{% connected_content https://query.petametrics.com/v3/lkdk9usg5av95fvs/userId/model :method post :headers {“x-api-key”: “theapikey”} :body “UseActivity”=false :content_type application/json :save json %}
```

Next, write your message, defining the content you would like to call with json. For example, `{{json.items[0].title}}`.

{% endraw %}

![An image showing a push campaign that includes LiftIgniter specific Connected Content calls. There is also Connected Content logic added to the image field.][1]

Once you put this message into the composer body, you can preview your message. You can even pull in images, shown in the following example:

![A preview image of what the message will look like once sent.][2]
