## Integration

Use [Liftigniter's REST API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2166502/liftigniter/7TFGvSV#9bdf75da-edd6-45ec-9c28-a0edefad1389) to insert personalized content into your messages. Once you have your Liftigniter account and Liftigniter is integrated into your app, use this template to call content into your messages. Feel free to reach out to Liftigniter's support team with any questions.

{% raw %}

Paste the following template into your message composer and change out the information as needed (`x-api-key`, `theapikey`, etc.).

```
{% connected_content https://query.petametrics.com/v3/lkdk9usg5av95fvs/userId/model :method post :headers {“x-api-key”: “theapikey”} :body “UseActivity”=false :content_type application/json :save json %}
```

Then, write your message as shown below, defining the content you would like to call with json. For example, `{{json.items[0].title}}`.

{% endraw %}

![liftigniter][1]

Once you put this message into the composer body, you can preview your message. You can even pull in images, as seen in the example below:

![liftigniter][2]

[1]: {% image_buster /assets/img/liftigniter.png %}
[2]: {% image_buster /assets/img/liftigniter2.png %}
