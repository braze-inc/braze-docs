## Integration

Follow the respective steps below to send dynamic SMS links for iOS and Android operating systems.

### iOS

{% alert important %}
To allow link preview images for iOS, users must add your brand (the sender) as a contact.
{% endalert %}

#### Step 1: Create a contact card campaign

After users save your brand as a contact, either through a [contact card]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/mms/contact_card/) or another method, they will be able to view **Tap to Load Preview** prompts and Movable Ink links.

#### Step 2: Send Movable Ink links

1. Create an SMS campaign in Movable Ink and generate your click-through URL.
2. In the Braze dashboard, go to **Campaigns** and set up a new SMS/MMS campaign from the **Create Campaign** dropdown.
3. In the SMS campaign composer:
    - Set your subscription group.
    - Enter your message.
    - Add your Movable Ink link **last**, after all other text in the message body. <br><br>![2]{: style="max-width:50%;"}

After users load the link preview, a personalized image will render with the ability to link out to your website, app, or landing page.

### Android (Google and Samsung devices)

Android users aren't required to save your brand as a contact in order to receive dynamic SMS link previews. However, it is still recommended so that the device can automatically load the link previews.

Users who haven't saved your brand as a contact and have turned on automatic previews will have to select **Tap to load preview** to load the preview image.

## Considerations

- Only include one preview link in your message. Content will not be generated with multiple links in your SMS body. 
- Don't include any characters after your preview link or the experience might break.
