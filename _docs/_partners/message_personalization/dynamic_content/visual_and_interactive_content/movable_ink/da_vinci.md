## Integration

To get started with the integration, contact your Movable Ink account team for assistance. Movable Ink will provide access and setup instructions accordingly. You will need to provide Movable Ink with a set of Braze API credentials to enable Da Vinci to send email deployments through Braze’s Messaging API.

When connected, Movable Ink will:

- Work with the client and Braze to set up the brand’s Da Vinci account to successfully deploy with Braze.
- Capture brand-specific configurations to align with your messaging use cases.
- Conduct comprehensive testing and quality assurance to validate that emails are delivered as intended and meet all performance and operational standards.
