#### Blings Enterprise plan
Request the HTML snippet from your Blings representative. 


### Step 2: Create a Braze campaign  

In Braze, create a new email or in-app message campaign and insert the Blings HTML snippet.

![Blings Braze Campaign.]({% image_buster /assets/img/blings/blings_braze_campaign.png %})  

### Step 3: Test and launch  

Preview the campaign in Braze to confirm the personalized fields are populating correctly. Once validated, deploy your MP5 campaign at scale.
