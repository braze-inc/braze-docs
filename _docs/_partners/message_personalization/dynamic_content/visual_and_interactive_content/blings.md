| Blings account  | A Blings account is required to take advantage of this partnership.         |  

## Integration  

### Step 1: Obtain Your Blings HTML Snippet

- **Blings Business and Free plans**: Locate and copy your HTML snippet directly in the Blings app.
- **Blings Enterprise plan**: Request the HTML snippet from your Blings representative.

### Step 2: Create a Braze campaign  

In Braze, create a new email or in-app message campaign and insert the HTML snippet provided by Blings.  

### Step 3: Replace the default Blings parameters with Braze personalization Liquid tags  

Swap the placeholders in the snippet provided by Blings with Braze Liquid personalization tags so that user data is dynamically pulled.  

For example, let's consider this snippet: 

{% raw %}
```liquid
https://blings.mp5.live/timhortons?&user_points={Points}&Name={First_Name}
```  

After being updated with Braze tokens, the snippet would become:  

```liquid
https://blings.mp5.live/timhortons?&user_points={{custom_attribute.${points}}}&Name={{${first_name}}}
```  
{% endraw %}

### Step 4: Test and launch  

Preview the campaign in Braze to confirm the personalized fields are populating correctly. After validating, deploy your personalized interactive video campaign at scale.
