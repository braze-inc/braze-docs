## Integration  

### Step 1: Obtain your Blings HTML snippet

{% tabs %}
{% tab Blings business and free plans %}

#### Blings business and free plans

Locate and copy your HTML snippet directly in the Blings app.

1. Go to the **Connect** tab of the selected MP5 Project.
2. Add Braze Liquid tags to the corresponding variables in the Blings **Connect** page. The tags will dynamically populate values in the HTML snippet. 

![Blings HTML snippet.]({% image_buster /assets/img/blings/blings_connect_audience.png %}){: style="max-width:70%;"}  

{% endtab %}
{% tab Blings Enterprise plan %}

#### Blings Enterprise plan

Request the HTML snippet from your Blings representative. 

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Step 2: Create a Braze campaign  

In Braze, create a new email or in-app message campaign and insert the Blings HTML snippet.

![Blings Braze Campaign.]({% image_buster /assets/img/blings/blings_braze_campaign.png %})  

### Step 3: Test and launch  

Preview the campaign in Braze to confirm the personalized fields are populating correctly. Then, deploy your MP5 campaign at scale.

![Blings Braze preview.]({% image_buster /assets/img/blings/blings_braze_preview.png %}){: style="max-width:70%;"}
