# About Mixpanel & Currents

> [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/) is a business analytics platform. You can export events from your Braze integration to Mixpanel in order to perform deeper analysis. Data collected is used to build custom reports and measure user engagement and retention.

To get started, find the following information from your Mixpanel dashboard under the `Settings > Project Settings` menu:

-   Mixpanel API Secret
-   Mixpanel Token

Add this information to the Mixpanel Currents integration page on the dashboard, and press save.

## Integration Details

A list of the events that can be exported from Braze to Mixpanel is below. All events sent to Mixpanel will include the user's `external_user_id` as the Mixpanel Distinct ID. At this time, Braze does not send event data for users who do not have their `external_user_id` set.

You can export two types of events events to Mixpanel: "Message Engagement Events" consisting of the Braze Events that are directly related to message sending, and "Customer Behavior Events" including other App or Website activity such as Sessions, Custom events, and Purchases tracked through the platform. All Custom events are prefixed with `[Braze Custom Event]`. Custom event properties and Purchase event properties are prefixed with `[Custom event property]` and `[Purchase property]`, respectively.

Please contact your Account Manager or [open a support ticket][support] if you need access to additional event entitlements.


# Mixpanel Cohort Import

Use Braze and Mixpanel's partnership to configure your integration and import Mixpanel cohorts directly into Braze for retargeting, creating a full loop of data from one system to another. This allows you to perform a deeper analysis using Mixpanel and seamlessly execute on your strategies using Braze.

You can manage the Mixpanel Cohort Import process from the Technology Partners page in your Braze account. Any integration that you set up will count towards your account's data point volume.

{% alert update %}
Behavior for `dispatch_id` differs between Canvas and Campaigns because Braze treats Canvas steps (except for Entry Steps, which can be scheduled) as triggered events, even when they are "scheduled". [Learn more about `dispatch_id` behavior in Canvas and Campaigns here]({{site.baseurl}}/help/help_articles/data/dispatch_id/).

_Update noted in August 2019._
