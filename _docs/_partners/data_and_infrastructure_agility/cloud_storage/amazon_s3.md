# Amazon S3

> [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is a highly scalable storage system offered by Amazon Web Services.

The Braze and Amazon S3 integration features two integration strategies:

- Leverage [Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/), enabling you to store data there until you want to connect it to other platforms, tools, and locations.
- Use dashboard data exports (such as CSV exports and engagement reports).

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Amazon S3 account | An Amazon S3 account is required to take advantage of this partnership. |
| Dedicated S3 bucket | Before integrating with Amazon S3, you must create an S3 bucket for your app.<br><br>If you already have an S3 bucket, we still recommend creating a new bucket specifically for Braze so you can limit permissions. Refer to the following instructions on how to create a new bucket. |
| Currents | In order to export data back into Amazon S3, you need to have [Braze Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/#access-currents) set up for your account. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation" }

#### Creating a new S3 bucket

To create a bucket for your app, do the following:

1. Open the [Amazon S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/) and follow the instructions to **Sign in** or **Create an Account with AWS**. 
2. After signing in, select **S3** from the **Storage & Content Delivery** category. 
3. Select **Create Bucket** on the next screen. 
4. You'll be prompted to create your bucket and select a region.

{% alert note %}
Currents does not support buckets with [Object Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html) configured.
{% endalert %}

## Integration

Braze has two different integration strategies with Amazon S3â€”one for [Braze Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/) and one for all dashboard data exports (such as CSV exports or engagement reports). Both integrations support two different authentication or authorization methods:

- [AWS secret access key method](#aws-secret-key-auth-method)
- [AWS role ARN method](#aws-role-arn-auth-method)

## AWS secret key auth method

This authentication method generates a secret key and an access key ID that enables Braze to authenticate as a user on your AWS account to write data to your bucket.

### Step 1: Create user {#secret-key-1}

To retrieve your access key ID and secret access key, you'll need to [create an IAM user and administrators group in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html).

### Step 2: Get credentials {#secret-key-2}

After creating a new user, select **Show User Security Credentials** to reveal your access key ID and secret access key. Next, note these credentials somewhere or select the **Download Credentials** button, as you will need to input these into the Braze dashboard later on.

![][11]

### Step 3: Create policy {#secret-key-3}

Navigate to **Policies** > **Get Started** > **Create Policy** to add permissions for your user. Next, select **Create Your Own Policy**. This will give limited permissions, so Braze can only access the specified buckets. 

![][12]

{% alert note %}
Different policies are required for Currents and Dashboard Data Export. `s3:GetObject` is required to allow Braze's backend to perform error handling.
{% endalert %}

Specify a policy name of your choice, and input the following code snippet into the **Policy Document** section. Be sure to replace `INSERTBUCKETNAME` with your bucket name. Without these permissions the integration will fail a credentials check and not be created.

{% tabs %}
{% tab Braze Currents %}
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::INSERTBUCKETNAME"]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:GetObject"],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::INSERTBUCKETNAME/*"]
        }
    ]
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Dashboard Data Export %}
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::INSERTBUCKETNAME"]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject", "s3:DeleteObject"],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::INSERTBUCKETNAME*", "arn:aws:s3:::INSERTBUCKETNAME/", "arn:aws:s3:::INSERTBUCKETNAME"]
        }
    ]
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Step 4: Attach policy {#secret-key-4}

After creating a new policy, go to **Users** and select into your specific user. In the **Permissions** tab, select **Attach Policy**, and select the new policy you created. Now, you're ready to link your AWS credentials to your Braze account.

![][13]

### Step 5: Link Braze to AWS {#secret-key-5}

{% tabs %}
{% tab Braze Currents %}

In Braze, go to **Partner Integrations** > **Data Export**.

Next, select **Create Current** then **Amazon S3 Data Export**.

Name your Current. In the **Credentials** section, make sure **AWS Secret Access Key** is selected, then input your S3 access ID, AWS secret access key, and AWS S3 bucket name in the designated fields.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/currents-s3-example.png)

{% alert warning %}
Keep your AWS access key ID and secret access key up to date. If your connector's credentials expire, the connector will stop sending events. If this persists for more than **48 hours**, the connector's events will be dropped, and data will be permanently lost.
{% endalert %}

You can also add the following customization based on your needs:

- **Folder Path:** Defaults to `currents`. If this folder does not exist, Braze will automatically create one for you. 
- **Server-Side, At-Rest AES-256 Encryption:** Defaults to OFF and includes the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header.

Select **Launch Current** to continue.

A notification will inform you whether your credentials have been successfully validated. AWS S3 should now be set up for Braze Currents.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Dashboard Data Export %}

In Braze, go to **Partner Integrations** > **Technology Partners** and select **Amazon S3**.

On the **AWS Credentials** page, make sure **AWS Secret Access Key** is selected, then input your AWS access ID, AWS secret access key, and AWS S3 bucket name in the designated fields. When inputting your secret key, select **Test Credentials** first to ensure your credentials work, then select **Save** when successful.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/s3_tech_partners.png)

{% alert tip %}
You can always retrieve new credentials by navigating to your user, and selecting **Create Access Key** in the **Security Credentials** tab within the AWS Console.
{% endalert %}

A notification will inform you whether your credentials have been successfully validated. AWS S3 should now be integrated into your Braze account.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## AWS role ARN auth method

This authentication method generates a role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that enables Braze's Amazon account to authenticate as a member of the role you created to write data to your bucket.

### Step 1: Create policy {#role-arn-1}

To get started, sign in to the AWS management console as an account administrator. Navigate to the IAM section of the AWS Console, select **Policies** in the navigation bar, and select **Create Policy**.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/create_policy_1_list.png)

{% alert note %}
Different policies are required for Currents and Dashboard Data Export. `s3:GetObject` is required to allow Braze's backend to perform error handling.
{% endalert %}

Open the **JSON** tab and input the following code snippet into the **Policy Document** section. Be sure to replace `INSERTBUCKETNAME` with your bucket name. Select **Review Policy** when you're finished.

{% tabs %}
{% tab Braze Currents %}

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::INSERTBUCKETNAME"]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:GetObject"],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::INSERTBUCKETNAME/*"]
        }
    ]
}
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab Dashboard Data Export %}

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::INSERTBUCKETNAME"]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:GetObject","s3:DeleteObject"],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::INSERTBUCKETNAME/*"]
        }
    ]
}
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Next, give the policy a name and a description and select **Create Policy**.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/create_policy_3_name.png)

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/create_policy_4_created.png)

### Step 2: Create role {#role-arn-2}

Within the same IAM section of the console, select **Roles** > **Create Role**.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/create_role_1_list.png)

Retrieve your Braze account ID and external ID from your Braze account:
- **Currents**: In Braze, go to **Partner Integrations** > **Data Export**. Next, select **Create Current** then **Amazon S3 Data Export**. Here you will find the identifiers needed to create your role.
- **Dashboard data export**: In Braze, go to **Partner Integrations** > **Technology Partners** and select **Amazon S3**. Here you'll find the identifiers needed to create your role.

Back on the AWS Console, select **Another AWS Account** as the trusted entity selector type. Provide your Braze account ID, check the **Require external ID** box, and enter the Braze external ID. Select **Next** when complete.

![The S3 "Create Role" page. This page has fields for role name, role description, trusted entities, policies, and permissions boundary.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/create_role_2_another.png)

### Step 3: Attach policy {#role-arn-3}

Next, attach the policy you created earlier to the role. Search for the policy in the search bar, and place a checkmark next to the policy to attach it. Select **Next** when complete.

![Role ARN]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/create_role_3_attach.png)

Give the role a name and a description, and select **Create Role**.

![Role ARN]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/create_role_4_name.png)

You should now see your newly created Role on the list.

### Step 4: Link to Braze AWS {#role-arn-4}

In the AWS Console, find your newly created role in the list. Select the name to open up the details of that role.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/create_role_5_created.png)

Take note of the **Role ARN** at the top of the Role summary page.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/create_role_6_summary.png)

Return to your Braze account and copy the role ARN into the field provided.

{% tabs %}
{% tab Braze Currents %}

In Braze, go to the **Currents** page under **Integrations**. Next, select **Create Current** and select **Amazon S3 Data Export**

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/currents-role-arn.png)

Give your Current a name. Then, in the **Credentials** section, make sure **AWS Role ARN** is selected, then provide your role ARN and AWS S3 bucket name in the designated fields.

You can also add the following customization based on your needs:

- Folder Path (defaults to `currents`)
- Server-Side, At-Rest AES-256 Encryption (defaults to OFF) - Includes the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header

Select **Launch Current** to continue. A notification will indicate if your credentials have been successfully validated. AWS S3 should now be set up for Braze Currents.

{% alert important %}
If you receive an "S3 credentials are invalid" error, this may be due to integrating too quickly after creating a role in AWS. Wait and try again. 
{% endalert %}

{% endtab %}
{% tab Dashboard Data Export %}

In Braze, go to the **Technology Partners** page under **Integrations** and select **Amazon S3**.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/data-export-role-arn.png)

On the **AWS Credentials** page, make sure the **AWS Role ARN** radio button is selected, then input your role ARN and AWS S3 bucket name in the designated fields. Select **Test Credentials** first to confirm your credentials work properly, then select **Save** when successful.

{% alert tip %}
You can always retrieve new credentials by navigating to your user, and selecting **Create Access Key** on the **Security Credentials** tab within the AWS Console.
{% endalert %}

A notification will inform you whether your credentials have been successfully validated. AWS S3 should now be integrated into your Braze account.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Export behavior

Users that have integrated a cloud data storage solution, and are trying to export APIs, dashboard reports, or CSV reports will experience the following:

- All API exports will not return a download URL in the response body and must be retrieved through data storage.
- All dashboard reports and CSV reports will be sent to the users email for download (no storage permissions required) and backed up on Data Storage. 

## Multiple connectors

If you intend to create more than one Currents connector to send to your S3 bucket, you will be able to use the same credentials, but must specify a different folder path for each. These can be created in the same workspace, or split and created within multiple workspaces. You also have the option of creating a single policy for each integration, or create one policy that covers both integrations. 

If you plan on using the same S3 bucket for both Currents and data exports, you will need to create two separate policies as each integration requires different permissions.
