{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Step 2: Select action
{% tabs %}
{% tab User Consent Update %}

1. When complete, click **Done** and choose **Add Action**. Note that the action you choose will depend on what type of preference is being updated and your preferred endpoint.

- To update a user’s subscription group preferences, choose the **POST User Track - Attributes** action or the **POST Set Users Subscription Group Status** action.<br>![]({% image_buster /assets/img/onetrust/onetrust4.png %})<br><br>
2. Choose your desired Action, select your previously created Braze credentials, and click **Next**.<br>![]({% image_buster /assets/img/onetrust/onetrust5.png %})

{% endtab %}
{% tab User Deletion %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
#### Step 3: Update request body
{% tabs %}
{% tab User Consent Update %}

1. Update the body to include any necessary dynamic values. Make sure the body of the action matches the [`/users/track` endpoint](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track/) and the [`/subscription/status/set` endpoint](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/subscription_groups/post_update_user_subscription_group_status/).
2. Customize the workflow with additional parameters or conditional logic to meet your organization's needs.
3. When finished editing, click **Finish** and then **Activate** to enable the workflow.

{% alert note %}
When using the OneTrust workflows to update subscription group preferences in Braze, the `subscription_group_id` must match the ID set by Braze when the subscription group was created. You can access a subscription group’s `subscription_group_id` by navigating to the **Subscription Group** page in the Braze dashboard.
{% endalert %}

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/onetrust/onetrust6.png %})
