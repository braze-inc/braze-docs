# mParticle

{% include video.html id="Njhqwd36gZM" align="right" %}

> mParticle's customer data platform empowers you to do more with your data. Sophisticated marketers use mParticle to orchestrate data across their entire growth stack, enabling them to win in key customer journey moments.

The Braze and mParticle integration allows you to seamlessly control the flow of information between the two systems:
- [Sync mParticle cohorts to Braze](#cohort-import) for Braze campaign and Canvas segmentation.
- [Import event data across the two platforms](#data-import). This can be done through the mParticle kit integration and the server-to-server integration if you want to pipe backend data. 
- [Connect data to mParticle through Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/customer_data_platform/mParticle/mparticle_for_currents/), making it actionable across the entire growth stack. 

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |

## Integration

### Cohort import

Use Braze and mParticle's partnership to configure your integration and import mParticle cohorts directly into Braze for retargeting, creating a full loop of data from one system to another. Any integration you set up will count towards your account's data point volume.

#### Forwarding Audiences

mParticle offers three ways to set cohort membership attributes, controlled by the "[Send Segments As](#send_settings)" configuration setting. The processing of each option is described in the following list:

- **Single attribute** (default): mParticle will create a single custom attribute called `SegmentMembership`. The value of this attribute is a list of mParticle audience IDs that match the user. These audience IDs can be found in the mParticle dashboard under **Audiences**. For example, if an mParticle audience "Ibiza dreamers" has an audience ID of "11036", you will be able to segment these users by the audience ID "11036". ![mParticle segment membership][6]<br><br>
- **One attribute per segment**: mParticle will create a custom attribute for each audience that a user belongs to. ![mParticle custom attribute][7]<br><br>
- **Both single attribute and one attribute per segment**

#### Step 1: Create an audience in mParticle {#send_settings}

To create an audience in mParticle, navigate to **Audiences > Single Workspace > + New Audience**. Here you must provide the following fields:

- **API key**: Found in the Braze **Developer Console** under **Settings**.
- **API key operating system**: Select which operating system your Braze API key corresponds to. This selection will limit the types of push tokens forwarded on an audience update.
- **Send segments as**: The method of sending audiences to Braze: Single Attribute, One Attribute Per Segment, or Both. 
- **App group REST API key**:  Braze REST API key with full permissions. This can be created within the **Braze Dashboard > Developer Console > REST API Key > Create New API Key**
- **External identity type**: The mParticle user identity type to forward as an external ID to Braze. We recommend leaving this to the default value, Customer ID.
- **Email identity type**: The mParticle user identity type to forward as the email to Braze.
- **Braze instance**: Specify which cluster your Braze data will be forwarded to

Lastly **Save** your audience. 

Check out this article for more information on creating Braze [mParticle audiences](https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/audience/#configuration-settings).

#### Step 2: Segment users in Braze

In Braze, to create a segment of these users, navigate to **Segments** under **Engagement** and name your segment.
- **Single attribute**: Select `SegmentMembership` as your filter. Next, use the "matches regex" option and input your desired audience ID. ![mParticle segment filter "SegmentMembership" set as "matches Regex" and audience ID.][9]<br><br>
- **One attribute per segment**: Select your custom attribute as the filter. Next, use the "equals" option and choose the appropriate logic. ![mParticle segment filter "in possible parisians" set as "equals" and "true".][8]

Once saved, you can reference this segment during Canvas or campaign creation in the targeting users step.

#### Deactivating and deleting connections

Since mParticle does not directly maintain segments in Braze, it will not delete segments when the corresponding mParticle audience connection is deleted or deactivated. When this happens, mParticle will not update the audience user attributes in Braze to remove the audience from each user.

### Data import

Data can be imported by using the [embedded kit integration](#embedded-kit-integration) if you want to connect your mobile and web apps to Braze. You can also use the [server API integration](#server-api-integration) to pipe backend data into Braze.

{% alert note %}
Regardless of which approach you choose, you must integrate the [mParticle embedded kit](#embedded-kit-integration).
{% endalert %}

#### Embedded kit integration

The mParticle and Braze SDK will be present on your application through the embedded kit integration. However, unlike a direct Braze integration, mParticle takes care of calling the majority of Braze SDK code for you. Any mParticle methods you use to track user data will automatically be mapped to Braze's SDK. 

These mappings of mParticle’s SDK for [Android](https://github.com/mparticle-integrations/mparticle-android-integration-appboy), [iOS](https://github.com/mparticle-integrations/mparticle-apple-integration-appboy) and [Web](https://github.com/Appboy/integration-appboy) are open source and can be found on [mParticle’s GitHub page](https://github.com/mparticle-integrations). 

The embedded SDK integration allows you to take advantage of our full suite of features (Push, In-app Messages, News Feed, and all relevant message analytics tracking).

##### Step 1: Integrate the mParticle SDKs

Integrate the appropriate mParticle SDKs into your app based on your platform needs:

* [mParticle for Android](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/android/getting-started/)
* [mParticle for iOS](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/ios/getting-started/)
* [mParticle for Web](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/web/getting-started/)

##### Step 2: Complete mParticle's Braze event kit integration

While the Braze SDK is not required for this mParticle integration, the following mParticle Appboy Kit must be installed to forward data from your app to Braze.

mParticle's [Braze event kit integration guide](https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event/#kit-integration) will walk you through custom mParticle and Braze alignment instructions based on your messaging needs (Push, Location Tracking, etc.).

##### Step 3: Configure your mParticle dashboard to enable the Braze kit

In mParticle, navigate to **Setup > Outputs > Add Output** and select **Braze** to open the Braze kit configuration. **Save** once completed. 

![][3]

Provide the following fields on the Braze configuration page: 
- **API key**: Found in the Braze **Developer Console** under **Settings**. Note that API keys will differ for each platform (iOS, Android, and Web).
- **External identity type**: The mParticle user identity type to forward as an external ID to Braze. We recommend leaving this to the default value, Customer ID.
- **Braze instance**: Custom
- **Custom REST endpoint**: Your REST endpoint URL. Your endpoint will depend on the [Braze URL for your instance]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/rest_api/basics/#endpoints).
- **Custom SDK endpoint**: Given to you by your Braze support or account representative (e.g., `sdk.api.braze.com`). Leave this setting blank if you were not given a custom API endpoint.
- **Custom JavaScript endpoint**: Given to you by your Braze support or account representative. Leave this setting blank if you were not given a custom JavaScript endpoint.

#### Server API integration

This is an add-on to route your backend data to Braze if you're using mParticle's server-side SDKs (e.g., Ruby, Python, etc.). To set up this server-to-server integration with Braze, follow mParticle's documentation [here](https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/).

##### Connections settings for your Braze output

In mParticle, navigate to **Connections > Connect > [Your desired platform] > Connect Output** to add Braze as an output. **Save** once completed. 

![][4]

Provide the following fields on the Braze output page: 
- **App group REST API key**: A Braze REST API key with full permissions. This can be created within the **Braze Dashboard > Developer Console > REST API Key > Create New API Key**.
- **Custom REST endpoint**: Your REST endpoint URL. Your endpoint will depend on the [Braze URL for your instance]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/rest_api/basics/#endpoints). This should match the **Custom REST endpoint** provided in [this step](#step-3-configure-your-mparticle-dashboard-to-enable-the-braze-kit).

##### Data mapping

Not all data types that are supported on mParticle are supported by Braze.
- [Custom event properties]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_events/) support string, numeric, boolean, or date objects. It does not support arrays or nested objects.
- [Custom attributes]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/) support string, numerical, boolean, date objects and arrays, but does not support objects or nested objects.
