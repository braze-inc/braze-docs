# mParticle

{% include video.html id="Njhqwd36gZM" align="right" %}

> mParticle's customer data platform empowers you to do more with your data. Sophisticated marketers use mParticle to orchestrate data across their entire growth stack, enabling them to win in key customer journey moments.

You can improve your data flow by marrying mParticle and Braze for a seamless way to control the flow of information between systems. What's more, with Currents, Braze's real-time data export, you can also connect data to mParticle, and make it actionable across the entire growth stack.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement| Origin| Access| Description|
| ---| ---| ---|
| mParticle Account & Account Information | mParticle | [https://app.mparticle.com/login](https://app.mparticle.com/login) | You must have an active mParticle Account to utilize their services with Braze. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3 .reset-td-br-4}

If you want to connect your mobile and web apps to Braze, you will need to use the [embedded kit integration][5] below.

If you have backend data outside of your apps, you'll want to use the Server API integration to pipe that data into Braze.

Please note that regardless of approach, it is necessary to integrate the mParticle embedded kit.

## Embedded Kit Integration

Through the embedded kit integration, mParticle and Braze's SDK will both be present on your application. However, unlike a direct Braze integration, mParticle takes care of calling the majority of Braze SDK code for you. Any mParticle methods you use to track user data will automatically be mapped to Braze's SDK. These mappings of mParticle’s SDK for [Android](https://github.com/mparticle-integrations/mparticle-android-integration-appboy), [iOS](https://github.com/mparticle-integrations/mparticle-apple-integration-appboy) and [Web](https://github.com/Appboy/integration-appboy) are open source and can be found on [mParticle’s GitHub page](https://github.com/mparticle-integrations). 

The embedded SDK integration allows you to take advantage of our full suite of features (Push, In-app Messages, News Feed, and all relevant message analytics tracking).

### 1. Integrate the mParticle SDKs

Integrate the appropriate mParticle SDKs into your app based on your platform needs:

* [mParticle for Android](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/android/getting-started/)
* [mParticle for iOS](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/ios/getting-started/)
* [mParticle for Web](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/web/getting-started/)

### 2. Complete mParticle's Braze Event Kit Integration

While the Braze SDK is not required for this mParticle integration, the following mParticle Appboy Kit must be installed to forward data from your app to Braze.

mParticle's [Braze Event Kit Integration Guide](https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/event/#kit-integration) will walk you through custom mParticle and Braze alignment instructions based on your messaging needs (Push, Location Tracking, etc.).

### 3. Configure your mParticle dashboard to enable the Braze Kit.

![mParticle Event Config UI][3]

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| API Key | Found in __Developer Console__ under __Settings__. |
| External Identity Type | The mParticle User Identity type to forward as an External ID to Braze. We recommend leaving this to the default value, Customer ID. |
| Braze Instance | Select __Custom__. |
| Custom SDK Endpoint | Given to you by your Braze support or account representative (e.g., `sdk.api.braze.com` ).<br> If you were not given a custom API Endpoint, leave this setting blank. |
|Custom REST Endpoint | Your REST endpoint (e.g., `rest.iad.braze.com` ).<br> If you do not know which Braze instance you’re on, find your endpoint [here]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/rest_api/basics/#endpoints). |
| Custom JavaScript Endpoint | Given to you by your Braze support or account representative. If you were not given a custom JavaScript endpoint, leave this setting blank. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

{% alert important %}
API keys will be different for each platform (iOS, Android, and Web).
{% endalert %}

## Server API Integration

This is an add-on to route your backend data to Braze if you're using mParticle's Server-Side SDKs (e.g., Ruby, Python, etc.). To set up this server-to-server integration with Braze, please follow mParticle's documentation [here](https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/).

### Connections Settings for your Braze Output

These settings are located in mParticle’s __Connections__ tab under __Connect__. You will need to add Braze as an output.

![mParticle Connections Setting][4]

The App Group REST API Key required to input in mParticle's dashboard can be found in the [Developer Console][1] under the __API Settings__ tab.

![Braze Developer Console - API Settings][2]

Custom REST Endpoint: Set this to your relevant [REST API endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/rest_api/basics/#endpoints). This should match the __Custom REST Endpoint__ field in the Event Configuration for Braze found in your mParticle Dashboard in the __Setup__ tab under __Outputs__.


### Data Mapping
Not all data types that are supported on mParticle are supported by Braze.

- [Custom event properties]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_events/) support string, numeric, boolean, or date objects. It does not support arrays or nested objects.
- [Custom attributes]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/) support string, numerical, boolean, date objects and arrays, but does not support objects or nested objects.
