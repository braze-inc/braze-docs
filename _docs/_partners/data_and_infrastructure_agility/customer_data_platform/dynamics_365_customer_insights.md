## Integration

### Step 1: Set up Braze connection

In Customer Insights, navigate to **Admin > Connections**. Next, select **Add connections** and choose **Braze** to configure the connection. 

1. Give your connection a recognizable name in the **Display name** field. 
2. Choose who can use this connection. If you leave this field blank, the default will be Administrators. For more information, refer to [Allow contributors to use a connection for exports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-insights/connections#allow-contributors-to-use-a-connection-for-exports).
3. Provide your Braze API key to continue to sign in.
4. Select **I agree** to confirm the data and privacy compliance.
5. Select **Connect** to initialize the connection to Braze.
6. Select **Add yourself as export user** and provide your Customer Insights credentials.
7. Select **Save** to complete the connection. 

### Step 2: Configure an export

You can configure this export if you have access to a connection of this type. For more information, refer to [Exports overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-insights/export-destinations#set-up-a-new-export).

1. In Customer Insights, go to **Data > Exports**. To create a new export, select **Add destination**.
2. In the **Connection for export** field, choose a connection for the Braze section. If you don't see this section name, there are no connections of this type available to you. 
3. In the **Data matching** section, in the **Email** field, select the field that represents a customer's email address. Next, in the **Customer ID** field, select the field that represents the customer's Braze ID. You can also choose an additional, optional field for matching data. 
4. Lastly, select **Save**. 

Note that saving an export does not run the export immediately. This export will run with every [scheduled refresh](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-insights/system#schedule-tab). You can also [export data on demand](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-insights/export-destinations#run-exports-on-demand). 

### Using this integration

Once your segments have successfully exported to Braze, you will be able to find them by name and use them for targeting in your Braze campaigns and Canvases. Segments built in Braze will be created with the same name as the segment found in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights.
