## Integrations

### Audience membership

This integration is used to sync ActionIQ audience membership to Braze by creating custom attributes that denote whether a Braze profile is part of a segment. Each ActionIQ audience corresponds to a unique boolean custom attribute.

The standard naming convention for the custom attribute created is: `AIQ_<Audience ID>_<Split ID>`.

To create a segment of these users, do the following:
1. In Braze, navigate to **Segments**.
2. Create a new segment.
3. Select **Custom Attributes** as your filter.
4. From here, choose the ActionIQ custom attribute. 
5. After the segment is created, you can select it as an audience filter when creating a campaign or Canvas.

Additionally, this integration will update any custom or standard attribute in a Braze user profile with their ActionIQ attribute values.

#### Requirements

A Braze REST API key with `users.track` and `user.export.ids` permissions is required. This can be created in the Braze dashboard from **Settings** > **API Keys**. 

In ActionIQ, set up a Braze connection by providing your REST API key and Braze REST endpoint. 

To match to consumers in the Braze platform, the following identifiers must be included in your activation setting:
- `braze_id`
- `external_id`

### Events

You can configure the ActionIQ platform to receive event information through their streaming ingest service. This integration option forwards these events to Braze for marketers to use for orchestration or for triggering marketing campaigns. The event integration is able to send additional ActionIQ attributes as part of the properties in the event payload.

#### Requirements

A Braze REST API key with `users.track` and `user.export.ids` permissions is required. This can be created in the Braze dashboard from **Settings** > **API Keys**. 

The events integration sends the following information to Braze:
- Event name
- Consumer identifier (either `braze_id` or `external_id`)
- Timestamp
- Event properties, which are populated by any additional attributes in the export setting

### Triggered campaigns

This integration will trigger a campaign in Braze for all users in an ActionIQ segment. After you have configured your campaign's copy, multivariate testing, and re-eligibility rules, you can trigger it from any ActionIQ journey touchpoint by adding the Braze campaign ID to your export setting.

Optionally, you can include any other ActionIQ attributes in your export to populate your campaign copy. Those are sent with the `trigger_properties` object.

#### Requirements

A Braze REST API key with `campaigns.trigger.send` and `campaigns.list` permissions is required. This can be created in the Braze dashboard from **Settings** > **API Keys**.

The following values must be sent in your ActionIQ export to Braze:
- Consumer identifier (either `braze_id` or `external_id`)
- Campagin ID
