## Integration

### Audience membership

This integration is used to sync ActionIQ audience membership to Braze by creating custom attributes that denote whether a Braze profile is part of a segment. Each ActionIQ audience corresponds to a unique boolean custom attribute.

The standard naming convention for the custom attribute created is: `AIQ_<Audience ID>_<Split ID>`.

To create a segment of these users, In Braze, navigate to **Segments**, create a new segment, and select **Custom Attributes** as your filter. From here, you can choose the ActionIQ custom attribute. After the segment is created, you can select it as an audience filter when creating a campaign or Canvas.

#### Requirements

In ActionIQ, set up a Braze connection by providing your REST API key and Braze REST endpoint. 

To match to consumers in the Braze platform, the following identifiers must be included in your activation setting:
- `braze_id`
- `external_id`

Once your integration has been connected, information will start sending to Braze.

### Events

The ActionIQ platform can be configured to receive event information through its streaming ingest service. This other integration option forwards these Events to Braze, for marketers to use for orchestration or the triggering of marketing campaigns.

The event integration is able to send additional ActionIQ attributes as part of the properties within the event payload.

#### Requirements

The events integration sends the following information to Braze:
- Event name
- Consumer identifier (either `braze_id` or `external_id`)
- Timestamp
- Event properties, which are populated by any additional attributes in the export setting
