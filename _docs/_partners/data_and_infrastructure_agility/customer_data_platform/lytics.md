## Integration

This section describes how to export Lytics data into Braze.

### Step 1: Create an authorization

In Lytics, navigate to the **Authorization** dashboard within the **Data** console in the navigation bar. Select **Create New Authorization** and search for and select **Braze**.

In the **Configure Authorization** prompt that appears, provide a label and a description and input your REST API key and Braze instance. Select **Complete** when finished.

![][2]{: style="max-width:80%;"}

### Step 2: Create a new job

In Lytics, navigate to the **Jobs** dashboard within the **Data** console in the navigation bar. Select **Create New Job** and search for and select **Braze**.  In the **Select Job Type** prompt that appears, select **Export Audience**.

![][3]{: style="max-width:80%;"}

Next, choose an authorization within the **Select Authorization** options.

![][4]{: style="max-width:80%;"}

### Step 3: Configure the job

Within the **Configure Job** prompt, provide a label and an optional description. Next, From the **Braze External User ID Field** input, select the field in Lytics that contains the Braze external user ID (`braze_id`). The next step is the most importantâ€”select the audiences to export to Braze.

![][5]{: style="max-width:80%;"}

Finally, choose the preferable option for the **Existing Users** checkbox. Leaving this box checked will add users who already exist in the selected Lytics audience. If unchecked, users will only be exported to Braze when entering or exiting the audience after the workflow begins.

{% alert note %}
By checking this box, all existing users in the selected audience will be pushed into Braze. This will result in a data point being incurred per user per audience for the initial sync.
{% endalert %}

Click **Complete** when finished to initiate the export and save.

![][6]{: style="max-width:80%;"}

After the export job is configured, Lytics will send the selected audiences to Braze through the native integration. The following is a sample audience showing the JSON structure of the audience sent to Braze.

```json
{
    "lytics_to_braze_audience": [{
            "external_id": "ABC124ID",
            "lytics_segments": {
                "add": [
                    "lytics_all",
                    "lytics_new"
                ]
            }
        },
        {
            "external_id": "XYZ234ID",
            "lytics_segments": {
                "add": [
                    "lytics_known"
                ],
                "remove": [
                    "lytics_new"
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Importing data from Braze to Lytics

You can import audience data from Braze to Lytics using the following methods:

- [Using webhooks](#using-webhooks)
- [From a CSV file](#from-a-csv-file)

![][8]{: style="max-width:80%;"}

#### Step 2: Configure the Lytics webhook URL

The Lytics webhook URL is used by Braze to send a message to the Lytics API from Braze. This message can be used to personalize your campaigns in Lytics or can be used to enrich your Lytics Customer Profile. The following two parameters are required to be added within the Lytics webhook URL:

- Lytics Account Number
- Lytics API token

Configure your webhook URL as follows:

```
https://api.lytics.io/c/<ACCOUNT-NUMBER>/braze_users?key=<LYTICS-API-TOKEN>
```

Replace `<ACCOUNT-NUMBER>` with your account number and `<LYTICS-API-TOKEN>` with your Lytics API token.

#### Step 3: Create a Webhook on Braze 

In Braze, create a new [webhook campaign]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/webhooks/creating_a_webhook/). Add the Lytics webhook URL in the **Webhook URL** field.

After defining the request type (HTTP `POST` method), and configuring the rest of the webhook details, your webhook is ready for testing and deployment. Here is a sample body of the POST request after configuring the webhook in Braze:

```json
{
  "city": "AnyTown",
  "country": "United States",
  "first_name": "John",
  "gender": "male",
  "language": "English",
  "last_name": "Smith",
  "date_of_birth": "19820101",
  "phone_number": "5551231234",
  "time_zone": "GMT+7",
  "twitter_handle": "johnsmith",
  "email": "john.smith@email.com",
  "braze_id": "xxxxxx" 
}
```

### From a CSV file

This section describes how to import Braze user data from a segment into Lytics.

#### Step 1: Create an authorization

In Lytics, navigate to the **Authorization** dashboard within the **Data** console in the navigation bar. Select **Create New Authorization** and search for and select **Custom Integrations**.

Select the preferrred type of SFTP authorization based on your business and security requirements. The folllowing authorization types are supported for importing files into Lytics via SFTP:

- Client SFTP Server Authorization
- Client SFTP Server Authorization with PGP Private Key
- Lytics Managed SFTP Server Authorization

Public key SFTP authorizations are for SFTP export only.

![][9]{: style="max-width:80%;"}

In the **Configure Authorization** prompt that appears, provide a label and a description and complete the rest of the configuration requirements. Click **Complete** when finished.

#### Step 2: Export your segment data to CSV

In Braze, navigate to **Audience** > **Segments**. Locate the segment you want to export, then select <i class="fas fa-gear" aria-label="Settings"></i> and then **CSV Export User Data**. You can export up to 500,000 users in a segment. For details, refer to [Exporting segment data to CSV]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/export_braze_data/segment_data_to_csv).

#### Step 3: Configure a CSV Import Job

In Lytics, navigate to the **Jobs** dashboard within the **Data** console in the navigation bar. Select **Create New Job** and search for and select **Custom Integrations**.

Next, select the job type. To import Braze CSV files into Lytics, select **Import CSV** as the job type.
