# Segment Personas

> [Segment](https://segment.com) is a customer data platform that helps you collect, clean, and activate your customer data. This article will give an overview of the connection between [Braze and Segment Personas](https://segment.com/docs/destinations/braze/#personas), as well as describe requirements and processes for proper implementation and usage.

The Braze and Segment integration allows you to use [Personas](https://segment.com/docs/personas/), Segment's built-in audience builder, to create segments of users based on data you have already collected across various sources. These users will then be assigned [custom attributes]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/) or [custom events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_events/#custom-events) that can be used to create Braze segments to use in campaign and Canvas retargeting.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Segment account | A [Segment account](https://app.segment.com/login) is required to take advantage of this partnership. |
| Braze destination | You must have already [set up Braze as a destination]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/customer_data_platform/segment/segment/#connection-settings/) in your Segment integration.<br><br>This includes providing the correct Braze data center and REST API key in your [connection settings]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/customer_data_platform/segment/segment/#connection-settings). |

## Integration

### Step 1: Create a Segment computed trait or audience

1. In Segment, navigate to the **Computed Traits** or **Audiences** tab in **Personas**, and click **New**.
2. Create your computed trait or audience. A lightning bolt in the top corner of the page will indicate if the computation updates in real-time.
3. Next, select **Braze** as your destination. 
4. Preview your audience by clicking  **Review & Create**. By default, Segment queries all historical data to set the current value of the computed trait and audience. To omit this data, uncheck **Historical Backfill**.
5. In the computed trait or audience settings, adjust the connection settings based on how you would like your data sent to Braze.

#### Computed traits and audiences

[Computed traits](https://segment.com/docs/personas/computed-traits/) and [audiences](https://segment.com/docs/personas/audiences/) can be sent to Braze as custom attributes or custom events.
- Traits and audiences sent using the `identify` call will appear in Braze as custom attributes.
- Traits and audiences sent using the `track` call will appear in Braze as custom events.

You can choose which method to use (or choose to use both) when you connect the computed trait to the Braze destination.

{% tabs %}
{% tab Identify %}

You can send computed traits and audiences to Braze as `identify` calls to create custom attributes in Braze. 

For example, if you have a Personas computed trait for “Last Product Viewed Item,” you would find `last_product_viewed_item` in the user’s Braze profile under **Custom Attributes**. If this were instead a Personas audience, you would find your audience listed under **Custom Attributes** set as `true`.

| Computed Trait | Audiences |
| -------------- | --------- |
| ![The custom attribute section within a user profile lists "last_product_viewed_item" as "Sweater".]({% image_buster /assets/img/segment/last_viewed-id-braze.png %}) | ![The custom attribute section within a user profile lists "dormant_shopper" as "true".]({% image_buster /assets/img/segment/dormant-identify-braze.png %}) |

{% endtab %}
{% tab Track %}

You can send computed traits and audiences to Braze as `track` calls to create custom events in Braze. 

Continuing the previous example, if a user has a computed trait for “Last Product Viewed Item”, it will appear on users' Braze profiles as `Trait Computed` with the corresponding count and most recent timestamp under **Custom Events**. If this were instead a Personas audience, you would find your audience, count, and most recent timestamp listed under **Custom Attributes** set as `true`.

| Computed Trait | Audiences |
| -------------- | --------- |
| ![The custom event section within a user profile lists "Trait Computed" "1" time, with the last time being "20 hours ago".]({% image_buster /assets/img/segment/last_viewed-track-braze.png %}) | ![The custom attribute section within a user profile lists "Audience Entered" "1" time, with the last time being "March 9 at 1:45 am".]({% image_buster /assets/img/segment/dormant-track-braze.png %}) |

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Step 2: Segment users in Braze

In Braze, to create a segment of these users, navigate to **Segments** under **Engagement**, create a new segment, and name your segment. Next, based on which call you used:
- **Identify**: Select **custom attribute** as the filter and locate your custom attribute. Next, use the "matches regex" option (trait) or the "equals" option (audience) and input the appropriate variable.
- **Track**: Select **custom event** as the filter and locate your custom event. Next, use the "more than", "less than", or "exactly" option, and insert your desired value. This will depend on how you want to define your segment.

Once saved, you can reference this segment during Canvas or campaign creation in the targeting users step.

## Sync time

Though the default setting for the Braze to Segment Personas connection is `Realtime`, there are some filters that will disqualify the persona from syncing in real-time, including some time-based filters which restrict your audience's size at the time of message send.

## Segment debugger testing

Segment's dashboard provides a "Debugger" feature that allows customers to test whether data from a "Source" is transferring to a "Destination" as expected.

This feature connects to Braze's [users/track endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track/), meaning that it can only be used for identified users (users who already have a user ID for their Braze user profile).

This will not work for a side-by-side Braze integration. No server data will go through if you haven't input the correct Braze REST API information.
