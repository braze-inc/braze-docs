# Segment for Currents  

> [Segment](https://segment.com) is a customer data platform that helps you collect, clean, and activate your customer data. This article will give an overview of the connection between Braze Currents and Segment and describe requirements and processes for proper implementation and usage.

The Braze and Segment integration allows you to leverage Braze Currents to export your Braze events to Segment to drive deeper analytics into conversions, retention, and product usage. 

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Segment account | A [Segment account](https://app.segment.com/login) is required to take advantage of this partnership. |
| Braze destination | You must have already [set up Braze as a destination]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/customer_data_platform/segment/segment/#connection-settings/) in your Segment integration.<br><br>This includes providing the correct Braze data center and REST API key in your [connection settings]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/customer_data_platform/segment/segment/#connection-settings). |
| Currents | In order to export data back into Segment, you need to have [Braze Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/#access-currents) set up for your account. |

## Integration

### Step 1: Obtain Segment write key

1. In your Segment dashboard, select your Segment source. Next, go to **Settings > API keys**. Here you will find the **Segment Write Key**.
2. In Braze, navigate to **Currents > + Create Currents > Create Segment Export**.
3. Next, provide an integration name, contact email, Segment write key, and Segment region.

![The Segment Currents page in Braze. Here, you can find fields for integration name, contact email, segment region, and API key.][3]

{% alert warning %}
It's important to keep your Segment write key up to date. If your connector's credentials expire, the connector will stop sending events. If this persists for more than **48 hours**, the connector's events will be dropped, and data will be permanently lost.
{% endalert %}

### Step 2: Export message engagement events 

Next, select the message engagement events you would like to export. Reference the following export events and properties table listed. All events sent to Segment will include the user's `external_user_id` as the `userId`. At this time, Braze does not send event data for users who do not have their `external_user_id` set.

Lastly, select **Launch Current**.

{% alert warning %}
If you intend to create more than one of the same Currents connectors (for example, two message engagement event connectors), they must be in different app groups. Because the Braze Segment Currents integration cannot isolate events by different apps in a single app group, failure to do this will lead to unnecessary data deduping and lost data.

{% alert note %}
News Feed is being deprecated. Braze recommends that customers who use our News Feed tool move over to our Content Cards messaging channelâ€”it's more flexible, customizable, and reliable. Check out the [migration guide]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/migrating_from_news_feed/) for more.
