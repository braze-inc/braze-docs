## Integration

The following Currents integration is supported for both [Amazon S3](#setting-up-braze-currents-for-s3) and [Google Cloud Storage](#setting-up-braze-currents-for-google-cloud-storage).

### Setting up Braze Currents for S3

#### Step 1: Locate your external ID {#step-one}

In the [Fivetran Dashboard](https://fivetran.com/dashboard), click on **+ Connector** and select the **Braze** connector to launch the setup form. Next, select **Amazon S3**. Note the external ID provided here; you will need it to allow Fivetran to access your S3 bucket. 

![The Fivetran set up Braze connector form. The external ID field needed for this step is located in the middle of the page in a light grey box.]({% image_buster /assets/img/fivetran_braze_setupform_as3.png %})

#### Step 2: Give Fivetran access to a specified S3 bucket

##### Creating an IAM policy

Open the [Amazon IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#home) and navigate to **Policies > Create Policy**.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/fivetran_as3_iam.png %})

Next, click on the **JSON** tab and paste the following policy. Make sure to replace `{your-bucket-name}` with the name of your S3 bucket.

{% raw %}
```json
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
"s3:Get*",
"s3:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::{your-bucket-name}/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
"s3:Get*",
"s3:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::{your-bucket-name}"
    }
  ]
}
```
{% endraw %}

Lastly, click **Review Policy** and give the policy a unique name and description. Click **Create Policy** to build your policy.

##### Create an IAM role {#step-two}

In AWS, navigate to **Roles**, then select **Create New Role**.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/fivetran_iam_new_role.png %})

Select **Another AWS Account** and provide the Fivetran account ID `834469178297`. Make sure to check the **Require external ID** checkbox. Here, you will provide the external ID found in step 1.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/fivetran_another_aws_account.png %})

Next, click **Next: Permissions** to select the policy you just created.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/fivetran_as3_select_policy.png %})

Click **Next: Review**, name your new role (i.e., Fivetran), and click **Create Role**. Once created, click the role you just created, and note the Role ARN shown.

![The Amazon S3 ARN listed in the role.]({% image_buster /assets/img/fivetran_iam_role_arn.png %})

{% alert note %}
You can specify permissions for the Role ARN that you designate for Fivetran. Giving selective permissions to this Role will allow Fivetran to only sync what it has permissions to see.
{% endalert %}

#### Step 3: Complete the Fivetran connector

In Fivetran, click on **+ Connector** and select the **Braze** connector to launch the setup form. Within the form, fill the given fields with the appropriate values:
- `Destination schema`: A unique schema name.
- `API URL`: Your Braze REST API endpoint.
- `API Key`: Your Braze REST API key. 
- `External ID`: The external ID set in [step 2](#step-two) of the Currents set up directions. This ID is a fixed value.
- `Bucket`: Found in your Braze account by navigating to **Integration > Currents > [Your Current name] > Bucket Name**.
- `Role ARN`: The Role ARN can be found in [step 1](#step-one) of the Current setup directions.

{% alert important %}
Ensure **Amazon S3** is selected as the **Cloud Storage** choice.
{% endalert %}

Lastly, click **Save & Test**, and Fivetran will do the rest by syncing with the data from your Braze account!

### Setting up Braze Currents for Google Cloud Storage

#### Step 1: Retrieve your Fivetran email from Google Cloud Storage {#step-one2}

In the [Fivetran dashboard](https://fivetran.com/dashboard), click on **+ Connector** and select the **Braze** connector to launch the setup form. Next, select **Google Cloud storage**. Make a note of the email address that appears.

![The Fivetran set up Braze connector form. The email field needed for this step is located in the middle of the page in a light grey box.]({% image_buster /assets/img/fivetran_braze_setupform_gcs.png %})

#### Step 2: Grant bucket access

Navigate to your [Google Storage Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser) and select the bucket you configured Braze Currents with, and click on **Edit bucket permissions**.

![The Google Storage Console available buckets. Locate a bucket and click the vertical three dot symbol to open the drop down that allows you to edit bucket permissions.]({% image_buster /assets/img/fivetran_edit_bucket_permissions_gcs.png %})

Next, grant `Storage Object Viewer` access to the email from [step 1](#step-one2) by adding the email as a member. Make a note of the bucket name; you will need it in the next step to configure Fivetran.
