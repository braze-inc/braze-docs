# Amplitude cohort import

> This article covers how to import user cohorts from [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) to Braze. For more information on integrating Amplitude and its other functionalities, see the main [Amplitude article]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/analytics/amplitude/amplitude_audiences/).

## Data import integration

Any integration you set up will count toward your account's data point volume.

### Step 1: Get the Braze data import key

In Braze, navigate to **Partner Integrations** > **Technology Partners** and select **Amplitude**. Here, you will find the REST endpoint and generate your Braze data import key. 

Once generated, you can create a new key or invalidate an existing one. The data import key and the REST endpoint are used in the next step when setting up a postback in Amplitude's dashboard.<br><br>![]({% image_buster /assets/img/amplitude3.png %})

### Step 2: Set up the Braze integration in Amplitude

In Amplitude, navigate to **Sources & Destinations** > **[project name]** > **Destinations** > **Braze**. In the prompt that appears, provide the Braze data import key and REST endpoint, and click **Save**.

### Step 3: Export an Amplitude cohort to Braze

First, to export users from Amplitude to Braze, create a [cohort](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/231881448-Behavioral-Cohorts) of users you wish to export. Amplitude can sync cohorts to Braze using the following identifiers:
- User Alias
- Device ID
- User ID (External ID)

Once you have created a cohort, click **Sync to...** to export these users to Braze.

#### Defining sync cadence

Cohort syncs can be set to be one-time sync, scheduled as daily or hourly, or even real-time which updates every minute. Make sure to select an option that makes sense for your business needs while also being mindful of consuming [data points]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/data_points/).

### Step 4: Segment users in Braze

In Braze, to create a segment of these users, navigate to **Segments** under **Engagement**, name your segment, and select **Amplitude Cohorts** as the filter. Next, use the "includes" option and choose the cohort you created in Amplitude. 

![In the Braze segment builder, the filter "amplitude_cohorts" is set to "includes_value" and "Amplitude cohort test".]({% image_buster /assets/img/amplitude2.png %})

After saving, you can reference this segment during Canvas or campaign creation in the targeting users step.

## User Matching

Identified users can be matched by either their `external_id` or `alias`. Anonymous users can be matched by their `device_id`. Identified users who were originally created as anonymous users can't be identified by their `device_id`, and must be identified by their `external_id` or `alias`.
