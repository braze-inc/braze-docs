## Data import integration

To integrate Braze and Tinyclues, you must configure the Tinyclues platform, export an existing Tinyclues campaign, and create a user cohort segment in Braze that can be used to target users in future campaigns.

### Step 1: Get the Braze data import key

In Braze, navigate to **Technology Partners** and select **Tinyclues**. Here, you will find your REST Endpoint and generate your Braze data import key. Once generated, you can create a new key or invalidate an existing one.<br><br>![][6]{: style="max-width:90%;"} 

To complete the integration, you will need to provide the data import key and REST endpoint to your Tinyclues data operations team. Tinyclues will then establish the connection and reach out to you once the setup is complete.

### Step 2: Export a campaign from the Tinyclues platform

Each time you want to create a cohort of Tinyclues users to use in Braze, you'll have to first export it from the Tinyclues platform.

In Tinyclues, select the campaign(s) you want to export and click **Export Campaigns**. Upon export, the audience will be automatically uploaded to your Braze account.

### Step 3: Create a segment from the Tinyclues custom audience

In Braze, navigate to **Segments**, name your Tinyclues cohort segment, and select **Tinyclues Cohorts** as your filter. From here, you can choose which Tinyclues cohort you wish to include. Once created, you can select your Tinyclues cohort segment as an audience filter when creating a campaign or Canvas.
