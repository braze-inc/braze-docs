# Mixpanel cohort import

> This article describes how to import user cohorts from [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/) to Braze. For more information on integrating Mixpanel and its other functionalities, see the main [Mixpanel article]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/analytics/mixpanel_for_currents/).

## Data import integration

Any integration you set up will count toward your account's data point volume.

In adherence to Mixpanel's data retention policies, events sent before January 1, 2010 will be removed during import.

### Step 1: Get the Braze data import key

In Braze, navigate to **Partner Integrations** > **Technology Partners** and select **Mixpanel**. Here, you will find the REST endpoint and generate your Braze data import key. 

{% alert note %}
If you are using the [older navigation]({{site.baseurl}}/navigation), you can find **Technology Partners** under **Integrations**.
{% endalert %}

Once generated, you can create a new key or invalidate an existing one. The data import key and the REST endpoint are used in the next step when setting up a postback in Mixpanel's dashboard.<br><br>![]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/currents-mixpanel-edit.png %})

### Step 2: Set up the Braze integration in Mixpanel

In Mixpanel, navigate to **Data Management > Integrations.** Next, select the Braze integration tab and click **Connect**. In the prompt that appears, provide the Braze data import key and REST endpoint, and click **Continue**.

### Step 3: Export a Mixpanel cohort to Braze

In Mixpanel, navigate to **Data Management > Cohorts**. Select the cohort to send to Braze and then select **Export to Braze**. Lastly, select a one-time sync or dynamic sync. Selecting dynamic sync will sync your Braze cohort every 15 minutes to match users in Mixpanel.

### Step 4: Segment users in Braze

In Braze, to create a segment of these users, go to **Audience** > **Segments**, name your segment, and select **Mixpanel_Cohorts** as the filter. Next, use the "includes" option and choose the cohort you created in Mixpanel. 

![In the Braze segment builder, the user attributes filter "Mixpanel cohorts" is set to "includes" and "Braze cohort".]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/mixpanel1.png %})

After saving, you can reference this segment during Canvas or campaign creation in the targeting users step.

## User Matching

Identified users can be matched by either their `external_id` or `alias`. Anonymous users can be matched by their `device_id`. Identified users who were originally created as anonymous users can't be identified by their `device_id`, and must be identified by their `external_id` or `alias`.
