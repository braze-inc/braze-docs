# About Xamarin

> Xamarin is an app development platform that empowers developers to build, test, and monitor consumer and enterprise applications.

Xamarin and Braze enable customers to build native applications for multiple platforms on a shared codebase. Developers will be able to see the same IDE, APIs, and language, allowing them to get up and running quickly across a variety of platforms.

# Integration

Please see Braze's Platform Integration Guides to [integrate Xamarin]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/xamarin/sdk_integration/).
