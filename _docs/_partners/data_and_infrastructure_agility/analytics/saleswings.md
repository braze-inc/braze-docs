## Use cases

{% tabs %}
{% tab Lead Scoring %}

SalesWings provides Braze customers with [a flexible way to qualify leads, contacts, and accounts with state-of-the-art lead scoring](https://www.saleswingsapp.com/braze-lead-scoring-and-sales-insights?utm_source=braze&utm_campaign=technicaldocs) and lead grading capabilities. All your lead qualification data is natively pushed to Salesforce CRM and other systems where you want to manage and report on leads, contacts, accounts, and opportunities.

{% tab Sales and Marketing Alignment %}

{% endtab %}
{% tab Lead and Account Grading %}
SalesWings allows Braze customers to qualify leads and accounts based on profile data (typically CRM data). This is also referred to as “lead grading”, “fit scoring,” or “firmographic scoring”. Braze customers can send attribute data directly to SalesWings, and SalesWings can read any Salesforce CRM standard or custom objects data and records for holistic profile scoring.
{% endtab %}
{% tab Sales Insights for Sales Reps %}
SalesWings enables you to show your sales reps sales insights about their leads, contacts, and accounts (Marketo Sales Insights alternative). Essentially, you can surface any Braze and web engagement data to your sales team. The insights are natively embedded into Salesforce CRM and can be pushed to other CRMs or systems or via a Braze email as a “sales alert”.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Sales Alerts %}
SalesWings offers native email and Slack alerts, and you can set up report subscriptions in Salesforce that your sales team can access to get daily, weekly, and monthly email reports. Furthermore, through a Zapier integration, you can build additional workflows based on SalesWings lead qualification data.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Reporting in Salesforce CRM %}
Through SalesWings integration with Salesforce, you can build automated reporting with leads, contacts, accounts, and opportunities based on web engagement data and Braze campaign engagement. For instance, you can surface a list of hot leads to a sales team, with everyone who clicked on a specific email campaign or performed a specific action in your app or website.

## Integration

### Step 1: SalesWings account and configuration

[Schedule a demo][4] with the friendly SalesWings team to learn more about SalesWings.

### Step 2: Installing behavioral tracking on your website or app

Currently, there are two ways for you to collect behavioral data in SalesWings for lead scoring and sales insights:
* [Deploy the SalesWings tracking JavaScript][5] on the websites and apps where you want to track and identify leads
* Send behavioral lead activity data (and lead profile data) via SalesWings integration with Segment.com

### Step 3: Connecting SalesWings to Braze

Go to the [**SalesWings Settings** page][6] and expand the **Braze Integration** section.

![The Braze Integration section of the SalesWings Settings page.][7]

Copy the value of the **Identifier** column for the newly created key and paste it into the **Braze API key** field of the SalesWings **Braze Integration** section.

Add your Braze API endpoint as described in [API and SDK endpoints article][8], and enter it in the **Braze API endpoint** field. Copy the value of the **REST Endpoint** column and enter it in the **Braze API endpoint** field in the SalesWings **Braze Integration** section.

Then, click **Save Changes** in the SalesWings settings.

### Step 4: Configuring SalesWings lead scoring for Braze, CRM integration, and more

Consult the SalesWings services team for full onboarding support via the [website][1].

## Using this integration 

To trigger lead scoring and the creation of sales insights, SalesWings must identify a user on your website or app. This can occur in the following ways:

- **Form submissions:** When a user submits a web form, SalesWings will automatically identify all of your web form types (such as login, download, contact us, etc.) and resolve the identity of a user when they submit a form. 
- **URL clicks with a Braze ID or external ID:** A user clicks on a Braze marketing action, typically email clicks, banner clicks, or similar, leading to a page you are tracking with SalesWings.
- **Sales email tracking via Gmail and Outlook plugins (optional):** If you decide to empower your sales representative with email tracking plugins, they can trigger full website tracking of users by sending trackable links.
- **Segment.com identify event (optional):** If you are a Segment.com user, you can also resolve the identity of a user with Segment.com integration.

### Identifying users from URL clicks

You can identify users automatically when they click on a trackable URL (for example, email blasts, banners with URLs). To make a URL trackable, there are two ways to modify your website URLs in your emails, banners, or SMS by adding the parameter and ID at the end of your links.

1. Appending `?braze_id=` followed by {% raw %}`{{${braze_id}}}`{% endraw %} 
  - **Link example:** {% raw %}`https://www.your-website.com?braze_id={{${braze_id}}}`{% endraw %}<br><br>

2. Appending `?br_user_id=` followed by {% raw %}`{{${user_id}}}`{% endraw %}
  - **Link example:** {% raw %}`https://www.client-website.com?br_user_id={{${user_id}}}`{% endraw %}

The `braze_id` variable is set to an identifier of the user-generated by Braze and is always available. The `br_user_id` variable is set to the user's identifier in your system and may be missing in certain scenarios (for example, for anonymous users created by the Braze SDK). If both `braze_id` and `br_user_id` are used in a link, SalesWings will only consider the `braze_id` parameter.

For configuration and further troubleshooting, contact the [SalesWings services team][1] for onboarding support.
