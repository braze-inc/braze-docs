# Merkury

> [Merkury](https://merkury.merkleinc.com/) is Merkle’s enterprise identity platform that helps brands maximize consumer engagement, experience, and revenue through first-party cookieless identity capabilities. The `MerkuryID` unifies a brand’s known and unknown customer and prospects records, site/app visits, and consumer data to a single, persistent person ID.

The Braze and Merkury integration allows you to leverages the `MerkuryID` to increase site visitor recognition rates for Braze customers. Upon recognizing visitors that are brand email subscribers, Merkury will update the Braze profile to include the subscribers email address. The increased recognition capabilities of `MerkuryID` improves engagement and personalization opportunities and immediately increases site abandonment email send quantities and associated revenue.

Uses Merkle's client-side Merkury tag to capture Braze devices and forwards them to the Merkury identity connector endpoint for identification.

### Step 1: Setup Braze web SDK tag

You must have the [Braze Web SDK]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/initial_sdk_setup/#install-gtm) deployed on your website to use this integration.

### Step 2: Deploy Merkle's Merkury tag

Deploy the Merkury tag on your website. This will make the Merkury identity connector available on your website. A detailed guide with instructions will be provided to you by your Merkle account manager.

### Step 3: Create custom attributes

The following fields will be populated by Merkury identity connector and need to be created in Braze as [custom attributes]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes#custom-attributes).

| Attribute name | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hmid` | String | Merkle's Merkury ID |
| `confidence_score` | Number | How confident Merkury was able to identify (1-8, lower is better) |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3 role="presentation" }

### Step 4: Provide Merkle with user email universe

Merkle recommends a segmentation export of your permissible email universe. This can be followed up with daily exports of active permissible users.

The following fields are required:

- `braze_id`
- `external_id`
- email address
