# Kubit

> [Kubit](https://kubit.ai/) is a no-code, self-service analytics platform that delivers instant product insights. 

The Braze and Kubit integration allows you to [import Kubit user cohorts]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/cohort_import/kubit/) and target them in the Braze messaging. In addition, through the use of [Snowflake secure data sharing]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/data_warehouses/snowflake/), you can integrate the raw campaign and impression data from Braze with Kubit product analytics to measure the impact of these campaigns in real-time. This approach provides insights into the full lifecycle of your users without requiring any engineering efforts.

## Analyzing Braze data in Kubit

Take advantage of [Snowflake secure data sharing]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/data_warehouses/snowflake/) to share your Braze raw campaign and impression data with Kubit to incorporate them into Kubit's self-service analytics, providing you a full picture of users' lifecycle.

For reference, here are all the [Braze fields]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/download_file/data-sharing-raw-table-schemas.txt?ed79384e6ac6a97fe3b3d9f76852b7c2) which are available to be incorporated into Kubit analytics. The details of this step are very customer-specific and require special configurations. Talk to your Kubit account manager or [support@kubit.ai](support@kubit.ai) to learn more.
