> [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) is a product analytics and business intelligence platform.

The Braze and Amplitude bi-directional integration allows you to [import your Amplitude Cohorts]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/cohort_import/amplitude/), user traits, and events into Braze, as well as create segments that can target users in future campaigns or Canvases. You can also leverage Braze Currents to [export your Braze events to Amplitude]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/analytics/amplitude/amplitude_for_currents/#data-export-integration) to perform deeper analytics of your product and marketing data.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
| Amplitude account | An [Amplitude account](https://amplitude.com/) is required to take advantage of this partnership. |
| Currents | In order to export data back into Amplitude, you need to have [Braze Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/#access-currents) set up for your account. |

## Choose an integration 

Amplitude and Braze offer two different integration methods. Read through the following documentation to decide which methods will fit your needs:

- Braze Event Streaming: An integration that allows you to forward raw Amplitude event data straight to Braze.
- [Cohort import]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/cohort_import/amplitude/): An integration that allows you to forward Amplitude cohorts to Braze.

## Braze Event Streaming

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Braze REST API key | A Braze REST API key with the all permissions.<br><br> This can be created in the Braze dashboard from **Settings** > **API Keys**. |
| Braze REST endpoint | [Your REST endpoint URL][1]. Your endpoint will depend on the Braze URL for your instance. |
| Braze app identifier | The identifier for the app that will receive Amplitude events. This can be found within the **Braze Dashboard > Developer Console > Settings**. |

### Amplitude Setup

1. In Amplitude, navigate to **Data Destinations** then look up "Braze - Event Stream".
2. Enter a sync name and then click **Create Sync**.
3. Click **Edit** and provide your Braze REST API endpoint, REST API key, and Braze app identifier.
4. Use the send events filter to select the events to send. You can send all events, but Amplitude recommends choosing the most important ones. 
5. When finished, enable the destination and save. 

Refer to [Braze Event Streaming](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/destinations/braze/) for more information on this integration.

## Sync user traits and computations

Use Audiences to send user properties and computations to Braze as custom attributes. You will be able to sync user properties or computed properties for users who have been active in the last 90 days.

When a user's property or a computation updates, Amplitude will update a custom attribute in Braze with the same name as that user property or computation.

User trait and computation syncs will create new users for user identifiers that do not yet exist within Braze. Computations and user traits can only be synced using user identifiers. A user identifier can be any of the following:
- External ID
- Braze ID
- User alias
- Email address

Refer to Amplitude's documentation to learn more about [syncing properties, recommendations, and cohorts to third-party destinations](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060055531).

#### How to sync user properties and computations

In Amplitude Audiences, select **Syncs > Create Sync**.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/amplitude11.png %})

Next, choose to sync a user property, computation, cohort, or recommendation. 

{% tabs %}
{% tab Syncing user property %}

Select **User Property** and then the desired user property to sync.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/amplitude7.png %})

Next, select a destination to sync your user property to.

Lastly, define the frequency of your sync.

![Define your cadence as a one-time sync or scheduled sync.]({% image_buster /assets/img/amplitude9.png %})

{% endtab %}
{% tab Syncing computation %}

Select **Computation** and then the desired computation to sync

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/amplitude10.png %})

Next, select a destination to sync your computation to.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/amplitude8.png %})

Lastly, define the frequency of your sync.
