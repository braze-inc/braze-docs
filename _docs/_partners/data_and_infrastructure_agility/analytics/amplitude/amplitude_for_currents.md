# [![Braze Learning course]({% image_buster /assets/img/bl_icon2.png %})](https://learning.braze.com/amplitude-integration-with-braze){: style="float:right;width:120px;border:0;" class="noimgborder"}Amplitude for Currents

> [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) is a product analytics and business intelligence platform.

The Braze and Amplitude bi-directional integration allows you to [sync your Amplitude Cohorts]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/analytics/amplitude/amplitude_audiences/), user traits, and events into Braze as well as leverage Braze Currents to [export your Braze events to Amplitude](#data-export-integration) to perform deeper analytics of your product and marketing data.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
| Amplitude account | An [Amplitude account](https://amplitude.com/) is required to take advantage of this partnership. |
| Currents | In order to export data back into Amplitude, you need to have [Braze Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/#access-currents) set up for your account. |

## Data export integration

A full list of the events and event properties that can be exported from Braze to Amplitude can be found in the following sections. All events sent to Amplitude will include the user's `external_user_id` as the Amplitude user ID. Braze-specific event properties will be sent under the `event_properties` key in the data sent to Amplitude.

Braze will only send event data for users who have their `external_user_id` set or anonymous users who have their `device_id` set. For the anonymous users, you will need to sync your Amplitude device ID with the Braze device ID in the SDK. For example:
```java
amplitude.setDeviceId(Apppboy.getInstance(context).getDeviceId();)
```

You can export two types of events to Amplitude: [Message Engagement Events](#supported-currents-events) consisting of the Braze Events directly related to message sending, and [Customer Behavior Events](#supported-currents-events), including other app or website activity such as sessions, custom events, and purchases tracked through the platform. All regular events are prefixed with `[Appboy]`, and all custom events are prefixed with `[Appboy] [Custom Event]`. Custom event and purchase event properties are prefixed with `[Custom event property]` and `[Purchase property]`, respectively.

All cohorts named and imported into Braze will be prefixed with `[Amplitude]` and suffixed with their `cohort_id`. This means that a cohort named "TEST_COHORT" with the `cohort_id` "abcd1234" will be titled `[Amplitude] TEST_COHORT: abcd1234` in Braze filters.

Contact your account manager or open a [support ticket][support] if you need access to additional event entitlements.

### Step 1: Configure Amplitude Integration in Braze 

In Amplitude, locate your Amplitude export API key.

{% alert warning %}
Keep your Amplitude API Key up to date. If your connector's credentials expire, the connector will stop sending events. If this persists for more than **48 hours**, the connector's events will be dropped, and data will be permanently lost.
{% endalert %}

### Step 2: Create Braze Current

In Braze, navigate to **Currents > + Create Current > Create Amplitude Export**. Provide an integration name, contact email, Amplitude export API key, and Amplitude region in the listed fields. Next, select the events you want to track; a list of available events is provided. Lastly, click **Launch Current**

{% alert note %}
Events sent from Braze Currents to Amplitude will count towards your Amplitude event volume quota.

Check out Amplitude's [integration docs](https://amplitude.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000217351-Appboy-Amplitude-Integration#how-to-set-up-and-use-the-integration) to learn more. 
{% endtab %}

## Rate limits

Currents connect to Amplitude's HTTP API, which has a [rate limit](https://developers.amplitude.com/docs/http-api-v2#upload-limit) of 30 events/second per device and an undocumented limit of 500K events/day per device. If these thresholds are exceeded, Amplitude will throttle events logged through Currents. If a device in your integration exceeds this rate limit, you may experience a delay in when events from all devices will appear in Amplitude.

Devices should not report more than 30 events/second or 500K events/day under normal circumstances, and this event pattern should only occur due to a misconfigured integration. To avoid this type of delay, ensure that your SDK integration reports events at a normal rate as specified in our SDK integration instructions and refrain from running automated tests that generate many events for a single device.

## Supported Currents events

Braze supports exporting the following data listed in the Currents [user behavior]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/event_glossary/customer_behavior_events/) and [message engagement]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events/) event glossaries to Amplitude:
