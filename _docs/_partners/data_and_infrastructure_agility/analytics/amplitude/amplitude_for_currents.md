# Amplitude for Currents

{% include video.html id="7yadPjDImxQ" align="right" %}

> [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) is a product analytics and business intelligence platform. You can export the data events from your Braze integration to Amplitude in order to perform deep analysis of your product and marketing data.

To get started, find the following information from your Amplitude dashboard:

-   Amplitude API Key

Add this information to the Amplitude integration page on the dashboard, and press save.

![Amplitude]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/currents-amplitude-edit.png %})

{% alert warning %}
Keep your Amplitude API Key up to date. If your connector's credentials expire, the connector will stop sending events. If this persists for more than **48 hours**, the connector's events will be dropped and data will be permanently lost.
{% endalert %}

Amplitude's documentation is available [here](https://amplitude.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000217351-Appboy-Amplitude-Integration#how-to-set-up-and-use-the-integration).

## Data Import

Using Braze and Amplitude's deep partnership, you can configure your integration to import Amplitude cohorts directly into Braze for retargeting, creating a full loop of data from one system to another. This allows you to perform deep analysis using Amplitude and seamlessly execute on your strategies using Braze.

You can manage the Amplitude Data Import process from the Technology Partners page. Note that any integration that you setup will count towards your account's data point volume.

## Integration Details

A list of the events that can be exported from Braze to Amplitude is below. All events sent to Amplitude will include the user's `external_user_id` as the Amplitude User ID. Braze will only send event data for users who either have their `external_user_id` set, or anonymous users who have their `device_id` set. Braze-specific event properties will be sent under the `event_properties` key in the data sent to Amplitude. The properties for each event type are listed below.

You can export two types of events to Amplitude: "Message Engagement Events" consisting of the Braze Events that are directly related to message sending, and "Customer Behavior Events" including other App or Website activity such as Sessions, Custom events, and Purchases tracked through the platform. All regular events are prefixed with `[Appboy]`, and all custom events are prefixed with `[Appboy] [Custom Event]`. Custom event properties and purchase event properties are prefixed with `[Custom event property]` and `[Purchase property]`, respectively.

All cohorts named and imported into Braze will be prefixed with `[Amplitude]` and suffixed with their `cohort_id`. This means that a cohort named "COHORT_NAME" with the `cohort_id` "cxyzz3hz" will be titled `[Amplitude] COHORT_NAME: cxyzz3hz` in Braze filters.

Please contact your Account Manager or [open a support ticket][support] if you need access to additional event entitlements.

### Scheduled Cohort Syncs

Braze customers using Amplitude can schedule the timed cohort syncs between Amplitude and Braze. The can be set up as hourly or daily syncs of data to be sent into Braze.

{% alert important %}
Scheduled syncs will only send deltas of the updated data set.
{% endalert %}


## Rate Limits

Currents connects to Amplitude's HTTP API, which has a [Rate Limit](https://amplitude.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204771828-HTTP-API#upload-limit) of 60 events/second per device. Above that threshold, Amplitude will throttle events that are logged through Currents. If a device in your integration is sending above this rate limit, you may experience a delay in when events from all devices will appear in Amplitude.

Devices should not report more than 60 events/second under normal circumstances, and this event pattern should only occur due to a misconfigured integration. To avoid this type of delay, ensure that your SDK integration is reporting events at a normal rate as specified in our SDK integration instructions.
