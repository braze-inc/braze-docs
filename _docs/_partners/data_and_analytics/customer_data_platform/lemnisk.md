## Integrating Lemnisk

### Step 1: Create a Braze External API {#create-a-braze-external-api}

In Lemnisk, go to the External API channel. Select **Add New External API**. We'll now set up the [Track Users]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track) endpoint as an External API.

![ALT_TEXT]({% image_buster /assets/img/lemnisk/open_external_api.png %})

Under **Basic Details**, enter a name, description, channel, and channel identifier.

![ALT_TEXT]({% image_buster /assets/img/lemnisk/ext_api_basic_details.png %})

Under **External API details**, enter the relevant details for your `users.track` endpoint. You can define multiple engagement-level fields using {% raw %}`{{}}`{% endraw %}, which lets you set different values for different campaigns.

To finish setting up your Track Users configuration, select **Save**. You'll automatically be redirected to the **Test API** page.

### Step 2: Test the configuration

On the **Test API** page, enter some test values for the API parameters in your JSON tree view, then select **Test Configuration**.

If your credentials and API definitions are correct, Braze will return a success response.

Next, you'll verify that your events are being sent to Braze successfully. In the Braze dashboard, go to **Audience** > **Search Users**, then enter one of the identifiers from your External API configuration (such as a user email address). If everything is working correctly, the profile that received your test API trigger will be listed.

### Step 3: Trigger user events in Braze

1. On Lemnisk, create a new segment. For example, you could create a segment that sends information to Braze as soon as users submit a lead form.
2. In your new segment, go to **External API** > **Add Engagement**.
3. Under **Engagement Creation**, enter the basic details and select the configuration [you created previously](#create-a-braze-external-api).
4. Under **Configure Parameters**, you'll find the inputs for the Braze parameters you chose to expose at engagement level. In the following example, it shows _Name of the User_, _Product ID_, and _Event Time_.

6. When you're finished, activate the Engagement.
