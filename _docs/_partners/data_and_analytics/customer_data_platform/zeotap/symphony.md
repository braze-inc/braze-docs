# Zoetap Symphony

The Braze and Zoetap Symphony integration allows you to create real-time orchestrations and run email and push notification campaigns.

- Send first and last names through Zeotap, based on which users can send personalized emails through Braze.
- Send custom events or a purchase event in real-time through Zeotap, based on which users can create campaign triggers within Braze to target their customers

{% alert note %}
To create email marketing campaigns, onboard the raw emails to Zeotap by mapping them to `Email Raw` in the Zeotap Catalogue.
{% endalert %}

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Client Name | This is your client name for your Braze account. You can find it by navigating to the Braze Console. |
| Braze REST API key | A Braze REST API key with `users.track` permissions. <br><br> This can be created in the Braze dashboard from **Settings** > **API Keys**. |
| Instance | Your Braze instance can be obtained from your Braze onboarding manager or can be found on the [API overview page]({{site.baseurl}}/api/basics/#endpoints). |

## Integration

This section provides information about the two methods you can integrate with Braze:

### Method 1
In this method, you have to perform the following tasks:
1. Integrate the Braze SDK on your website or app.
2. Integrate Braze with Zeotap through Symphony.

- `User traits` must be mapped to the respective Braze fields under the **Data To Send** tab. If you map the `Event` and `Purchase` attributes, it leads to the duplication of events within Braze.
- Map `External ID` to `User ID` configured while setting up the Braze SDK.

When the integration is successfully set, you can create email and push notification campaigns based on custom attributes sent to Braze through Symphony.

### Method 2
In this method, you can integrate Braze with Zeotap through Symphony.

- This method does not support the Braze UI features such as in-app messaging, News Feed, content cards, or push notifications.
- Zeotap recommends mapping the `hashed email` available in Zeotap Catalogue to the `External ID`.

When the integration is successfully set, you can only create email campaigns based on custom attributes sent to Braze through Symphony.

## Data flow to Braze and supported identifiers

The data will flow from Zeotap to Braze using the [user track](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track/) API. The following points summarise the data flow:

1. Zeotap sends user profile attributes, custom attributes, custom events, and purchase fields.
2. You maps all the relevant Zeotap Catalogue fields to the Braze fields under the **Data To Send** tab.
3. The data is then uploaded to Braze.

You can find details about the different attributes under the [Data To Send](#data-to-send-tab) section.

## Destination setup

After applying filters or adding a condition for your users in Symphony, you can activate them in Braze under **Send to Destinations**. A new window opens, where you can set up your destination. You can use an existing destination from the list of **Available Destinations** or create a new one.

#### Add new destination
Perform the following steps to add a new destination:
1. Click **Add New Destination**.
2. Search for **Braze**.
3. Add the **Client Name**, **API Key**, and **Instance** and save the destination.

The destination is created and made available under **Available Destinations**.

#### Add workflow-level inputs
After creating a destination, next, you have to add workflow-level inputs, as mentioned below.
1. Choose the destination from the list of available destinations using the search feature.
2. The **Client Name**, **API Key**, and **Instance** fields are automatically populated based on the value you entered while creating the destination.
3. Enter the **Audience Name** you want to create for this workflow node. This is sent as a **Custom Attribute** to Braze.
4. Complete the Catalog to Destination mapping under the **Data To Send** tab. You can find details on how to perform the mapping below.

#### Data to send tab
The **Data To Send** tab allows the you to map the Zeotap Catalogue fields to the Braze fields that can be sent to Braze. The mapping can be done in one of the following ways:
- **Static Mapping** - There are certain fields that Zeotap automatically maps to the relevant Braze fields like email, phone, first name, last name, and so on.<br>
- **Dropdown Selection** - Map the relevant fields ingested in Zeotap to the Braze fields provided in the dropdown menu.<br>![Various user traits set in Zeotap, such as language, city, birthday, and more.][3]{: style="max-width:70%;"}<br>
- **Custom Data Input** - Add custom data mapped to the relevant Zeotap field and send to Braze.<br>![Selecting "loyalty_points" as the user trait in Zeotap.][4]{: style="max-width:70%;"}

## Supported attributes
You can find details of all the Braze fields in this section.

## Viewing data on Braze console

After you have mapped the relevant attributes to be sent and published in the workflow, the events start flowing to Braze based on the criteria defined. You can search by email ID or external ID on the Braze console.

![][2]

Various attributes come under different sections of the user dashboard within Braze.
- The **Profile** tab contains the user attributes.
- The **Custom Attributes** tab contains the custom attributes defined by the user.
- The **Custom Events** tab contains the custom event defined by the user.
- The **Purchases** tab contains the purchases done over a period of time by the user.

## Campaign creation

Users can create campaigns within Braze and activate users in real-time or based on the scheduled time. Campaigns can be triggered based on the actions performed by the user (custom event, purchase) or user attributes.
