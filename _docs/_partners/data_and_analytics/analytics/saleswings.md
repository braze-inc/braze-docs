{% endtab %}
{% tab Lead and Account Grading %}
SalesWings allows Braze customers to qualify leads and accounts based on profile data (typically CRM data). This is also referred to as “lead grading”, “fit scoring,” or “firmographic scoring”. Braze customers can send attribute data directly to SalesWings, and SalesWings can read any Salesforce CRM standard or custom objects data and records for holistic profile scoring.
{% endtab %}
{% tab Sales Insights for Sales Reps %}
SalesWings enables you to show your sales reps sales insights about their leads, contacts, and accounts (Marketo Sales Insights alternative). Essentially, you can surface any Braze and web engagement data to your sales team. The insights are natively embedded into Salesforce CRM and can be pushed to other CRMs or systems or via a Braze email as a “sales alert”.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Sales Alerts %}
SalesWings offers native email and Slack alerts, and you can set up report subscriptions in Salesforce that your sales team can access to get daily, weekly, and monthly email reports. Furthermore, through a Zapier integration, you can build additional workflows based on SalesWings lead qualification data.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Reporting in Salesforce CRM %}
Through the native SalesWings integration with Salesforce, you can build automated reporting with leads, contacts, accounts, and opportunities based on web engagement data and any Braze campaign engagement with a native Braze currents integration. For example, you can surface a list of hot leads to a sales team, with everyone who clicked on a specific email campaign or performed a specific action in your app or website.

### Step 2: Installing behavioral tracking on your website or app

There are several ways for you to collect behavioral data in SalesWings for lead and account scoring, identifying buyer intent and sales insights:
* [Deploy the SalesWings tracking JavaScript](https://support.saleswingsapp.com/en/collections/3285135-1-implementing-saleswings-tracking-script) on the websites and apps where you want to track and identify leads
* Ingest Braze events along with event properties into SalesWings via Braze Currents
* Send behavioral lead activity data (and lead profile data) via [SalesWings integration with Segment](https://support.saleswingsapp.com/en/articles/9258905-segment-com-integration)
* Send data straight to the SalesWings [API](https://support.saleswingsapp.com/en/articles/6930889-using-saleswings-open-api-to-send-events-to-saleswings) from a third-party solution

### Step 3: Connecting SalesWings to Braze

Go to the [**SalesWings Integrations** page](https://helium.saleswings.pro/integrations) and expand the **Braze Integration** section.

![The Braze Integration section of the SalesWings Settings page.]({% image_buster /assets/img/saleswings/saleswings_braze_lead_scoring_integration_settings.png %})

Copy the value of the **Identifier** column for the newly created key and paste it into the **Braze API key** field of the SalesWings **Braze Integration** section.

Add your Braze API endpoint as described in [API and SDK endpoints article]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/sdk_endpoints), and enter it in the **Braze API endpoint** field. Copy the value of the **REST Endpoint** column and enter it in the **Braze API endpoint** field in the SalesWings **Braze Integration** section.

Then, select **Save**.

### Step 4: Set up a custom Currents export to SalesWings (optional)

If you want to use [user behavior]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/event_glossary/customer_behavior_events) and [message engagement]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events) events for behavioral intelligence, lead and account scoring, produce sales insights, or generate reports in your CRM, go to the [**SalesWings Integrations** page](https://helium.saleswings.pro/integrations) and expand the **Braze Integration** section.

Select **Generate** under **Generate an API token to setup a Custom Currents Export**.

Then, [create a new Current]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/setting_up_currents) and select **Custom Currents Export** as the Current type.

In the **Credentials** section of the Current creation form, enter the API token you have generated on the [**SalesWings Integrations** page](https://helium.saleswings.pro/integrations) for **Bearer Token**, and `https://helium.saleswings.pro/api/braze/currents/events` for **Endpoint**.

### Step 5: Configuring SalesWings lead and account scoring for Braze, CRM integration, and more

Consult the SalesWings services team for full onboarding support via the [website](https://www.saleswingsapp.com/?utm_source=braze&utm_campaign=technicaldocs).

## Using this integration 

To trigger tie behavioral data and other data to leads and accounts, SalesWings must identify a user on your website or app, or through a third-party integration. This can occur in the following ways:

- **Form submissions:** When a user submits a web form, SalesWings will automatically identify all of your web form types (such as login, download, contact us, etc.) and resolve the identity of a user when they submit a form. 
- **URL clicks with a Braze ID or external ID:** A user clicks on a Braze marketing action, typically email clicks, banner clicks, or similar, leading to a page you are tracking with SalesWings.
- **Braze Currents events (optional):** If the Custom Currents export to SalesWings is configured, SalesWings will create an identified profile for every Braze user with an email that has events sent to the Current.
- **Sales email tracking via Gmail and Outlook plugins (optional):** If you decide to empower your sales representative with email tracking plugins, they can trigger full website tracking of users by sending trackable links.
- **Segment.com identify event (optional):** If you are a Segment.com user, you can also resolve the identity of a user with Segment.com integration.

### Identifying users from URL clicks

You can identify users automatically when they click on a trackable URL (for example, email blasts, banners with URLs). To make a URL trackable, there are two ways to modify your website URLs in your emails, banners, or SMS by adding the parameter and ID at the end of your links.

1. Appending `?braze_id=` followed by {% raw %}`{{${braze_id}}}`{% endraw %} 
  - **Link example:** {% raw %}`https://www.your-website.com?braze_id={{${braze_id}}}`{% endraw %}<br><br>

2. Appending `?br_user_id=` followed by {% raw %}`{{${user_id}}}`{% endraw %}
  - **Link example:** {% raw %}`https://www.client-website.com?br_user_id={{${user_id}}}`{% endraw %}

The `braze_id` variable is set to an identifier of the user-generated by Braze and is always available. The `br_user_id` variable is set to the user's identifier in your system and may be missing in certain scenarios (for example, for anonymous users created by the Braze SDK). If both `braze_id` and `br_user_id` are used in a link, SalesWings will only consider the `braze_id` parameter.

### Using Braze Currents events in your CRM

If you connect a Braze Current to SalesWings, SalesWings will create identified lead profiles for every Braze user with an email and record supported Braze events as lead activity. In your CRM, all data can automatically be aggregated on the lead’s account level. The recorded activity and data could be further combined with the behavioral data collected with the SalesWings tracking script or Segment.com, or by sending other data to the SalesWings API, and then used to identify the needs and sales-readiness of your prospects for your lead and account management processes.

The following table shows the Braze event types supported by SalesWings and their representation in SalesWings lead activity history and rule engine:

| Event Category | Event Type | Event Name in SalesWings |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Canvas Events | Entries | `[Nurturing] Added by marketing team onto the journey $canvas_name` |
| Customer Behavior Events | Custom Events | `[Custom Event tracked] $name` |

| Customer Behavior Events | Purchase Events | `[Purchase] Customer purchased $product_id for $price $currency` |
| Message Events | Content Card Click | `[Content Card engagement] Clicked on $campaign_name content card` |
| Message Events | Email Bounce | `[Alerting or negative] Email hard-bounced. This person's email appears to be no longer valid` |
| Message Events | Email Click | `[Email campaign engagement] Clicked in email $campaign_name on $url` |
| Message Events | Email Delivery | `[Nurturing] Received email $campaign_name` |
| Message Events | Email Open | `[Email campaign engagement] Opened email $campaign_name` |
| Message Events | Email Unsubscribe | `[Subscription status change] Unsubscribed from $campaign_name` |
| Message Events | In-App Message Click | `[In-app campaign engagement] Clicked on message $campaign_name` |
| Message Events | Push Open | `[Push notification engagement] Clicked on notification $campaign_name` |
| Message Events | SMS/MMS Inbound Received | `[SMS/mobile campaign engagement] We received a message from this person to our internal number $inbound_phone_number: $message_body` |
| Message Events | SMS/MMS Short Link Click | `[SMS/mobile campaign engagement] Clicked on $short_url` |
| Message Events | WhatsApp Inbound Received | `[WhatsApp engagement] We received a message from this person to our WhatsApp number $inbound_phone_number: $message_body` |
| Message Events | WhatsApp Read | `[WhatsApp engagement] Lead read our message from the $campaign_name campaign` |

You can then configure **Custom Event** > **Event Name** and **Custom Event** > **Event Property** conditions for SalesWings tags and scores against the SalesWings event names from the table above. The list of event properties available for conditions is prefilled with some of the commonly used entries, and you can always add new ones in the **Event Property** section of the [Rule Engine configuration page](https://helium.saleswings.pro/falcon).
