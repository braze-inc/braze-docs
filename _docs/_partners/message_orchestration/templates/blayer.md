## Integration

### Step 1: Create your in-app message

#### Set brand colors and fonts

In B.Layer, on the hamburger menu at the top of the page, click **Brand assets > add your brand assets**. Here, you can assign your brand color and fonts. 
You are all set. Now you can start designing your in-app message.

#### Design your in-app message

To design your in-app message, select a single in-app message. Next, style your message and add the components you need. Each component can be adjusted.

### Download your in-app message

Once you are done, download your message. Your message can be downloaded as a ZIP or inline HTML. 

### Step 2: Add B.Layer custom code

In Braze, create a custom code in-app message. If you have a ZIP file, drag and drop it into the box above the code section. If you have an inline HTML file, paste the inline HTML into the HTML section.

## Button tracking

With B.Layer, you can log button interactions or text input as a Braze attribute. That can be done within the editor. A popular example is an NPS survey.

B.Layer uses Braze button tracking added to the links you enter (for example, `?button=0`). This way, you can see the button clicks in the analytics part of your campaign.
