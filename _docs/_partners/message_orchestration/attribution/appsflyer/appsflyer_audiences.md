# AppsFlyer Audiences

> [AppsFlyer][1] is a mobile marketing analytics and attribution platform that helps you analyze and optimize your apps through marketing analytics, [mobile attribution][3], and deep linking. [AppsFlyer Audiences][2] allows you to build and connect audience segments to your partner networks.

The Braze and AppsFlyer integration allows you to drive user engagement and increase the efficiency of your remarketing programs by leveraging the power of the user segments built in AppsFlyer Audiences. Pass your AppsFlyer audiences (cohorts) directly to Braze to create powerful customer engagement campaigns targeted toward just the right users at just the right time. 

## Prerequisites

## Data import integration

### Step 1: Configure the AppsFlyer SDK

To use this integration, you must pass the user's Braze external ID to AppsFlyer using the `setPartnerData()` function of the AppsFlyer SDK:

#### Android 
```java
Map<String, Object> brazeData = new HashMap<>();
partnerData.put("external_user_id", "some-braze-external-id-value");
AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().setPartnerData("braze_int", brazeData);
```

#### iOS
```objc
NSDictionary *brazeInfo = @{
     @"external_user_id":@"some-braze-external-id-value"
};
[[AppsFlyerLib shared]  setPartnerDataWithPartnerId:@"braze_int" partnerInfo:brazeInfo];
```

### Step 2: Get the Braze data import key

In Braze, navigate to **Technology Partners** and select **AppsFlyer**. 

{% alert note %}
If you are using our [updated navigation]({{site.baseurl}}/navigation), you can find **Technology Partners** under **Partner Integrations**.
{% endalert %}

Here, you will find the REST endpoint and generate your Braze data import key. Once generated, you can create a new key or invalidate an existing one. The data import key and the REST endpoint are used in the next step when setting up a postback in AppsFlyer's dashboard.<br><br>![The "Data Import Using Cohort Import" box on the AppsFlyer technology page. In this box, you are shown the data import key and the REST endpoint.][5]{: style="max-width:90%;"}

### Step 3: Configure a Braze connection in AppsFlyer Audiences

1. In [AppsFlyer Audiences][4], go to the **Connections** tab and click **Add partner connection**.
2. Select Braze as the partner and give the connection a name.
3. Provide the data import key and Braze REST endpoint.
4. Save the connection, and it will be available to link to any new or existing audience.

### Step 4: Using AppsFlyer Audiences cohorts in Braze

Once an AppsFlyer audience has been uploaded to Braze, you can use it as a filter when defining segments in Braze by selecting the **AppsFlyer Cohorts** filter.
