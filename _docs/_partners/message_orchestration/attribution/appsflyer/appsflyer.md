# AppsFlyer

{% multi_lang_include video.html id="gQ9y2DA2LuQ" align="right" %}

> AppsFlyer is a mobile marketing analytics and attribution platform that helps you analyze and optimize your apps through marketing analytics, mobile attribution, and deep linking.

The Braze and AppsFlyer integration allows you to better understand how to optimize and build more holistic campaigns by leveraging mobile install attribution data from AppsFlyer. 

You can also pass your AppsFlyer audiences (cohorts) directly to Braze with the [AppsFlyer Audiences]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/cohort_import/appsflyer_audiences/) integration, allowing you to create powerful customer engagement campaigns targeted toward just the right users at just the right time. 

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
| AppsFlyer account | An AppsFlyer account is required to take advantage of this partnership. |
| iOS or Android app | This integration supports iOS and Android apps. Depending on your platform, code snippets may be required in your application. Details on these requirements can be found in step 1 of the integration process. |
| AppsFlyer SDK | In addition to the required Braze SDK, you must install the [AppsFlyer SDK](https://dev.appsflyer.com/hc/docs/getting-started).
| Email domain setup complete | You must have completed the [IP and domain setup step]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/email_setup/setting_up_ips_and_domains/) of setting up your email during Braze onboarding. |

## Integration

### Step 1: Map device ID

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Android %}
If you have an Android app, you will need to pass a unique Braze device ID to AppsFlyer. 

Make sure the following lines of code are inserted at the correct placeâ€”after the Braze SDK is launched and before the initialization code for the AppsFlyer SDK. See the AppsFlyer [Android SDK integration guide](https://dev.appsflyer.com/hc/docs/integrate-android-sdk#initializing-the-android-sdk) for more information.

```kotlin
val customData = HashMap<String, Any>()
Braze.getInstance(context).getDeviceIdAsync { deviceId ->
   customData["brazeCustomerId"] = deviceId
   setAdditionalData(customData)
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab ios %}
{% alert important %}
Prior to February 2023, our AppsFlyer attribution integration used the IDFV as the primary identifier to match iOS attribution data. It is not necessary for Braze customers using Objective-C to fetch the Braze `device_id` and sent to AppsFlyer upon install as there will be no disruption of service. 
{% endalert%}

For those using the Swift SDK v5.7.0+, if you wish to continue using IDFV as the mutual identifier, you must confirm that the `useUUIDAsDeviceId` field is set to `false` so there is no disruption of the integration. 

If set to `true`, you must implement the iOS device ID mapping for Swift in order to pass the Braze `device_id` to AppsFlyer upon app install in order for Braze to appropriately match iOS attributions.

{% subtabs local %}
{% subtab Swift %}

```swift
let configuration = Braze.Configuration(
    apiKey: "<BRAZE_API_KEY>",
    endpoint: "<BRAZE_ENDPOINT>")
configuration.useUUIDAsDeviceId = false
let braze = Braze(configuration: configuration)
AppsFlyerLib.shared().customData = ["brazeDeviceId": braze.deviceId]
```
{% endsubtab %}

{% subtab Objective-C %}
```objc
BRZConfiguration *configurations = [[BRZConfiguration alloc] initWithApiKey:@"BRAZE_API_KEY" endpoint:@"BRAZE_END_POINT"];
[configurations setUseUUIDAsDeviceId:NO];
Braze *braze = [[Braze alloc] initWithConfiguration:configurations];
[[AppsFlyerLib shared] setAdditionalData:@{
    @"brazeDeviceId": braze.deviceId
}];
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab unity %}
To map the device ID in Unity, use the following:

```
Appboy.AppboyBinding.getDeviceId()
Dictionary<string, string> customData = new Dictionary<string, string>();
customData.Add("brazeCustomerId", Appboy.AppboyBinding.getDeviceId());
AppsFlyer.setAdditionalData(customData);
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Step 2: Get the Braze data import key

In Braze, navigate to **Partner Integrations** > **Technology Partners** and select **AppsFlyer**. 

{% alert note %}
If you are using the [older navigation]({{site.baseurl}}/navigation), you can find **Technology Partners** under **Integrations**.
{% endalert %}

Here, you will find the REST endpoint and generate your Braze data import key. After the key is generated, you can create a new key or invalidate an existing one. The data import key and the REST endpoint are used in the next step when setting up a postback in AppsFlyer's dashboard.<br><br>![The "Data Import for Install Attribution" box available on the AppsFlyer Technology page. Included in this box is the data import key and the REST endpoint.][4]{: style="max-width:70%;"}

### Step 3: Configure Braze in AppsFlyer's dashboard

1. In AppsFlyer, navigate to the **Integrated Partners** page on the left bar. Next, search for **Braze** and click on Braze's logo to open up a configuration window.
2. Within the **Integration** tab, switch on **Activate Partner**.
3. Provide the data import key and REST endpoint that you found in Braze's dashboard. 
4. Toggle **Advanced Privacy** off and save your configuration.

Additional information on these instructions is available in [AppsFlyer's documentation][16].

### Step 4: Confirm the integration

Once Braze receives attribution data from AppsFlyer, the status connection indicator on the AppsFlyer technology partners page in Braze will change from "Not Connected" to "Connected". A timestamp of the last successful request will also be included. 

Note that this will not happen until we receive data about an attributed install. Organic installs, which should be excluded from the AppsFlyer postback, are ignored by our API and are not counted when determining if a successful connection was established.

### Step 5: Viewing user attribution data

#### Available data fields

Assuming you configure your integration as suggested, Braze will map all non-organic install data to segment filters.

| AppsFlyer data field | Braze segment filter |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| `media_source` | Attributed Source |
| `campaign` | Attributed Campaign |
| `af_adset` | Attributed Adgroup |
| `af_ad` | Attributed Ad |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation" }

Your user base can be segmented by attribution data in the Braze dashboard using the Install Attribution filters.

![Four available filters. The first is "Install Attribution Source is network_val_0". The second is "Install Attribution Source is campaign_val_0". The third is "Install Attribution Source is adgroup_val_0". The fourth is "Install Attribution Source is creative_val_0". Beside the listed filters, you can see how these attribution sources will be added to the user profile. In the "Install Attribution" box on a user's information page, Install Source is listed as network_val_0, campaign is listed as campaign_val_0, etc.][2]

Additionally, attribution data for a particular user is available on each user's profile in the Braze dashboard.

{% alert note %}
Attribution data for Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) campaigns is not available through our partners. These media sources do not permit their partners to share attribution data with third parties and, therefore, our partners cannot send that data to Braze.
{% endalert %}

## Integrate AppsFlyer with an Email Service Provider for deep linking

AppsFlyer integrates with both SendGrid and SparkPost as Email Service Providers (ESPs) to support deep linking and click tracking. Follow the instructions below to integrate with your ESP of choice.

{% alert tip %}
Deep links&#8212;links that direct users toward a specific page or place within an app or website&#8212;are used to create a tailored user experience. While widely used, issues can arise when using emailed deep links with click tracking, another important feature used in collecting user data. These issues are due to ESPs wrapping deep links in a click-recording domain, breaking the original link. As such, supporting deep links requires additional setup. By integrating AppsFlyer with either SendGrid or SparkPost, you avoid these issues. Learn more about this topic in [Universal links and App Links]({{site.baseurl}}/help/help_articles/email/universal_links/).
{% endalert %}

### Step 1: Set up OneLink in AppsFlyer

1. In AppsFlyer, select a OneLink template for your email campaigns. Make sure the template supports universal links (iOS) or App Links (Android). 
2. Configure your app to support deep linking with OneLink. See the [AppsFlyer documentation](https://dev.appsflyer.com/hc/docs/dl_work_flow#initial-setup) for details on configuring your app to support OneLink.

### Step 2: Configure your app to support universal links and App Links

Universal links (iOS) or App Links (Android) are allowed by the device's operating system to open a specified app when clicked.

Perform the following steps to support universal links and App Links.

{% tabs local %}
{% tab SendGrid %}
{% subtabs %}
{% subtab iOS %}
Set up the Apple App Site Association (AASA) file hosting to enable universal links in your emails.

1. Obtain an AASA file in one of the following methods:
    * If you've set up OneLink with universal links, you may already have an AASA file associated with OneLink. To obtain the AASA file, perform the following:
        * Copy the OneLink subdomain of your OneLink template. Make sure the template supports universal links.
        * Paste it instead of the placeholder in the following URL: `<OneLinkSubdomain>.onelink.me/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`
        * To download the AASA file, paste the OneLink URL into your browser's address bar and press **Enter**. The file will then be downloaded to your computer, and you can open and view its contents using any text editor.
    * [Apple's guide on universal links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content) explains how to create the AASA file.
2. Host the AASA file in your click-recording domain server. The file should be hosted in the path: `click.example.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`. 

See the [SendGrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/universal-links) to learn how to configure the AASA file for SendGrid and set up CDN services to host the AASA file.

{% alert important %}
Once the AASA file is hosted, any change of your OneLink configuration (modification or replacement) requires generating a new AASA file.
{% endalert %}
{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab Android %}
Set up the Digital Asset Links file hosting to enable App Links in your emails.

1. Obtain a Digital Asset Links file in one of the following methods:
    * If you've set up OneLink with App Links, you may already have a Digital Asset Links file associated with OneLink. To obtain the file, perform the following:
        * Copy the OneLink subdomain of your OneLink template. Make sure the template supports App Links.
        * Add `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` to the end of the OneLink URL.
        * To download the Digital Asset Links file, paste the OneLink URL into your browser's address bar and press **Enter**. For example, `https://<OneLinkSubdomain>.onelink.me/.well-known/assetlinks.json`. The file will then be downloaded to your computer, and you can open and view its contents using any text editor.
    * [Android's guide to App Links](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/app-link-indexing) explains how to create the Digital Asset Links file.
2. Host the Digital Asset Links file in your click-recording domain server. The file should be hosted in the path: `click.example.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`.

See the [SendGrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/universal-links) to learn how to configure the Digital Asset Links file for SendGrid and set up CDN services to host the Digital Asset Links file.

{% alert important %}
Once the Digital Asset Links file is hosted, any change of your OneLink configuration (modification or replacement) requires generating a new file.
{% endalert %}
{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab SparkPost %}
{% subtabs %}
{% subtab iOS %}
#### Step 2a: Set up AASA file hosting
Set up the Apple App Site Association (AASA) file hosting to enable universal links in your emails.

1. Obtain an AASA file in one of the following methods:
    * If you've set up OneLink with universal links, you may already have an AASA file associated with OneLink. To obtain the AASA file, perform the following:
        * Copy the OneLink subdomain of your OneLink template. Make sure the template supports universal links.
        * Paste it instead of the placeholder in the following URL: `<OneLinkSubdomain>.onelink.me/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`
        * To download the AASA file, paste the OneLink URL into your browser's address bar and press **Enter**. The file will then be downloaded to your computer, and you can open and view its contents using any text editor.
    * [Apple's guide on universal links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content) explains how to create the AASA file.
2. Host the AASA file in your click-recording domain server. The file should be hosted in the path: `click.example.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`. 

See the [SparkPost documentation](https://support.sparkpost.com/docs/tech-resources/deep-links-self-serve) to learn how to configure the AASA file for SparkPost and set custom link sub-paths.

{% alert important %}
Once the AASA file is hosted, any change of your OneLink configuration (modification or replacement) requires generating a new AASA file.
{% endalert %}

#### Step 2b: Redirect your click-tracking domain to your AASA file host
During your [email configuration]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/email_setup/setting_up_ips_and_domains/), you created a CNAME record in your DNS server. Perform the following steps after you verify your click-tracking domain in Braze. 

1. Delete the CNAME record that redirects your subdomain to the SparkPost domain.
2. Create a CNAME record that redirects your click-tracking domain to the CDN hosting your app AASA file, instead of the record you deleted above.

#### Step 2a: Set up Digital Asset Links file hosting
Set up the Digital Asset Links file hosting to enable App Links in your emails.

1. Obtain a Digital Asset Links file in one of the following methods:
    * If you've set up OneLink with App Links, you may already have a Digital Asset Links file associated with OneLink. To obtain the file, perform the following:
        * Copy the OneLink subdomain of your OneLink template. Make sure the template supports App Links.
        * Add `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` to the end of the OneLink URL.
        * To download the Digital Asset Links file, paste the OneLink URL into your browser's address bar and press **Enter**. For example, `https://<OneLinkSubdomain>.onelink.me/.well-known/assetlinks.json`. The file will then be downloaded to your computer, and you can open and view its contents using any text editor.
    * [Android's guide to App Links](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/app-link-indexing) explains how to create the Digital Asset Links file.
2. Host the Digital Asset Links file in your click-recording domain server. The file should be hosted in the path: `click.example.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`.

See the [SparkPost documentation](https://support.sparkpost.com/docs/tech-resources/deep-links-self-serve) to learn how to configure the Digital Asset Links file for SparkPost and set custom link sub-paths.

{% alert important %}
Once the Digital Asset Links file is hosted, any change of your OneLink configuration (modification or replacement) requires generating a new file.
{% endalert %}

#### Step 2b: Redirect your click-tracking domain to your digital asset links file host
During your [email configuration]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/email_setup/setting_up_ips_and_domains/), you created a CNAME record in your DNS server. Perform the following steps after you verify your click-tracking domain in Braze.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Step 3: Configure your AppsFlyer SDK to support deep linking

{% tabs local %}
{% tab SendGrid %}
{% subtabs %}
{% subtab iOS %}
#### Step 3a: Configure your SDK to support the AASA file
After you host the AASA file in your click-recording domain, configure your AppsFlyer SDK to support the AASA file.

1. In Xcode, select your project.
2. Select **Capabilities.**
3. Turn on **Associated Domains.**
4. Click **+**, and enter your click domain. For example, `applinks:click.example.com`.
When a click on the universal link occurs, your app is opened and the SDK is initiated. To enable the app to extract the OneLink behind the click domain and resolve the deep link, perform the following:

#### Step 3b: Handle the deep link data
1. Provide the click recording domain to the SDK API [`resolveDeepLinkURLs`](https://dev.appsflyer.com/hc/docs/ios-sdk-reference-appsflyerlib#resolvedeeplinkurls). This API needs to be called before SDK initialization. `AppsFlyerLib.shared().resolveDeepLinkURLs = ["click.example.com","spgo.io"]`
2. Use the [`onAppOpenAttribution`](https://dev.appsflyer.com/hc/docs/ios-sdk-reference-appsflyerlibdelegate#onappopenattribution) API to get the deep link parameters and handle the deep link data.

{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab Android %}
#### Step 3a: Configure your SDK to support the Digital Asset Links file

After you host the Digital Asset Links file in your click-recording domain in the previous step, configure your SDK to support the file.

In your Android manifest, add the click domain host and any prefix in the activity tag of the activity you want to deep link into.

```xml
<activity android:name=".DeepLinkActivity">
    <intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
      <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
      <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
      <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
      <data
        android:scheme="https"
        android:host="click.example.com"
        android:pathPrefix="/campaign"
      />
    </intent-filter>
  </activity>
```

#### Step 3b: Handle the deep link data
When a click on an App Link occurs, your app is opened and the SDK is initiated.  To enable the app to extract the OneLink behind the click domain and resolve the deep link, list the click domains in the SDK method [`setResolveDeepLinkURLs`](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408735106193#resolve-wrapped-deep-link-urls). This property needs to be set before SDK initialization. `AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().setResolveDeepLinkURLs("clickdomain.com", "myclickdomain.com", "anotherclickdomain.com");`
{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab SparkPost %}
{% subtabs %}
{% subtab iOS %}
#### Step 3a: Configure your SDK to support the AASA file
After you host the AASA file in your click-recording domain, configure your SDK to support the AASA file.

1. In Xcode, select your project.
2. Select **Capabilities.**
3. Turn on **Associated Domains.**
4. Click **+**, and enter your click domain. For example, `applinks:click.example.com`.

#### Step 3b: Handle the deep link data
When a click on the universal link occurs, your app is opened and the SDK is initiated. To enable the SDK to extract the OneLink behind the click domain, perform the following:
1. List the click domains in the SDK property  [`resolveDeepLinkURLs`](https://dev.appsflyer.com/hc/docs/ios-sdk-reference-appsflyerlib#resolvedeeplinkurls). Make sure to set this property before SDK initialization.
2. Make sure that List <em>spgo.io</em> is one of the listed domains. SparkPost owns this domain and it's part of the redirection flow. `AppsFlyerLib.shared().resolveDeepLinkURLs = ["click.example.com","spgo.io"]`
3. Use the [`onAppOpenAttribution`](https://dev.appsflyer.com/hc/docs/ios-sdk-reference-appsflyerlibdelegate#onappopenattribution) API to get the deep link parameters and handle the deep link data.
{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab Android %}
#### Step 3a: Configure your SDK to support the Digital Asset Links file

After you host the Digital Asset Links file in your click-recording domain in the previous step, configure your SDK to support the file.

In your Android manifest, add the click domain host and any prefix in the activity tag of the activity you want to deep link into.

```xml
<activity android:name=".DeepLinkActivity">
    <intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
      <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
      <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
      <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
      <data
        android:scheme="https"
        android:host="click.example.com"
        android:pathPrefix="/campaign"
      />
    </intent-filter>
  </activity>
```

#### Step 3b: Handle the App Link data
When a click on an App Link occurs, your app is opened and the SDK is initiated. To enable the app to extract the OneLink behind the click domain and resolve the deep link, perform the following:

1. List the click domains in the SDK method [`setResolveDeepLinkURLs`](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408735106193#resolve-wrapped-deep-link-urls). This property needs to be set before SDK initialization.
2. Make sure that List *spgo.io* is one of the listed domains. SparkPost owns this domain and it's part of the redirection flow. `AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().setResolveDeepLinkURLs("clickdomain.com", "myclickdomain.com", "spgo.io");`
{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Once you've completed the integration steps, you can perform quality assurance and troubleshooting by sending a deep link using OneLink. See the [AppsFlyer documentation](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001437497-Integrating-AppsFlyer-and-Braze#step-3-sending-your-first-email::2ffdb79a) for details on using OneLink.

### AppsFlyer click tracking URLs in Braze (optional)

You can use AppsFlyer's [OneLink attribution links](https://support.AppsFlyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001294118) in Braze campaigns across push, email, and more. This allows you to send back install or re-engagement attribution data from their Braze campaigns into AppsFlyer. As a result, you'll be able to measure your marketing efforts more effectively and make data-driven decisions.

You can simply create your OneLink tracking URL in AppsFlyer and directly insert it into your Braze campaigns. AppsFlyer will then use their [probabilistic attribution methodologies](https://support.AppsFlyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/207447053-Attribution-model-explained#probabilistic-modeling) to attribute the user that has clicked on the link. We recommend appending your AppsFlyer tracking links with a device identifier to improve the accuracy of attributions from your Braze campaigns. This will deterministically attribute the user that has clicked on the link.

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Android %}
For Android, Braze allows customers to opt-in to [Google Advertising ID collection (GAID)]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/initial_sdk_setup/optional_gaid_collection/#optional-google-advertising-id). The GAID is also collected natively through the AppsFlyer SDK integration. You can include the GAID in your AppsFlyer click tracking links by utilizing the following Liquid logic:
{% raw %}
```
{% if most_recently_used_device.${platform} == 'android' %}
aifa={{most_recently_used_device.${google_ad_id}}}
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab iOS %}
For iOS, both Braze and AppsFlyer automatically collect the IDFV natively through our SDK integrations. This can be used as the device identifier. You can include the IDFV in your AppsFlyer click tracking links by utilizing the following Liquid logic:

{% raw %}
```
{% if most_recently_used_device.${platform} == 'ios' %}
idfv={{most_recently_used_device.${id}}}
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
