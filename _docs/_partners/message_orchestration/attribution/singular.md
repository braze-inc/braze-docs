# Singular

> Singular is a unified marketing analytics platform that delivers attribution, cost aggregation, marketing analytics, creative reporting, and workflow automation.

The Braze and Singular integration allows you to import paid install attribution data to segment intelligently within your lifecycle campaigns.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
| Singular account | A Singular account is required to take advantage of this partnership. |
| iOS or Android app | This integration supports iOS and Android apps. Depending on your platform, code snippets may be required in your application. Details on these requirements can be found in step 1 of the integration process. |
| Singular SDK | In addition to the required Braze SDK, you must install the [Singular SDK](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360037640172-Getting-Started-with-the-Singular-SDK-S2S). |

## Integration

### Step 1: Map user IDs

#### Android

If you have an Android app, you will need to include the following code snippet, which passes a unique Braze user ID to Singular. For most setups, two lines of code must be added in an app's `onCreate()` method immediately after Singular's `init` method or session start. Braze's `device_id` must be available when the first “App Open” event is sent to Singular.

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
{
    // Other code
    // Init Singular SDK
   Singular.init(context, config); // context is Application Context
   // Code For Braze
   String appboyDeviceId = Braze.getInstance(context).getInstallTrackingId();
   Singular.event("App Open", "appboyUserID", appboyDeviceId);
}
```
#### iOS

If you have an iOS app, your IDFV will be collected by Singular and sent to Braze. This ID will then be mapped to a unique device ID in Braze.

Braze will still store IDFA values for users that have opted-in if you are collecting the IDFA with Braze, as described in our [iOS 14 Upgrade Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/ios_14/#idfa). Otherwise, the IDFV will be used as a fallback identifier to map users.

### Step 2: Get the Braze data import key

In Braze, navigate to **Technology Partners** and select **Singular**. Here, you will find the REST Endpoint and generate your Braze data import key. Once generated, you can create a new key or invalidate an existing one. 

You will need to provide the data import key and REST endpoint to your Singular account manager to complete the integration.<br><br>![This image shows the "Data Import for Install Attribution" box found in the Singular technology page.

### Step 3: Confirm the integration

Once Braze receives attribution data from Singular, the status connection indicator on the Singular technology partners page in Braze will change from "Not Connected" to "Connected". A timestamp of the last successful request will also be included. 

Note that this will not happen until we receive data about an attributed install. Organic installs, which should be excluded from the Singular postback, are ignored by our API and are not counted when determining if a successful connection was established.

## Facebook and Twitter attribution data

Attribution data for Facebook and Twitter campaigns is not available through our partners. These media sources do not permit their partners to share attribution data with third parties and, therefore, our partners cannot send that data to Braze.

## Singular click tracking URLs in Braze (optional)

Using click tracking links in your Braze campaigns will allow you to easily see which campaigns are driving app installs and re-engagement. As a result, you'll be able to measure your marketing efforts more effectively and make data-driven decisions on where to invest more resources for the maximum ROI.

To get started with Singular click tracking links, visit their [documentation](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-FAQ?navigation_side_bar=true). You can insert the Singular click tracking links into your Braze campaigns directly. Singular will then use their [probabilistic attribution methodologies](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/115000526963-Understanding-Singular-Mobile-App-Attribution?navigation_side_bar=true) to attribute the user that has clicked on the link. We recommend appending your Singular tracking links with a device identifier to improve the accuracy of attributions from your Braze campaigns. This will deterministically attribute the user that has clicked on the link.

{% tab Android %}
For Android, Braze allows customers to opt-in to [Google Advertising ID collection (GAID)]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/initial_sdk_setup/optional_gaid_collection/#optional-google-advertising-id). The GAID is also collected natively through the Singular SDK integration. You can include the GAID in your Singular click tracking links by utilizing the following Liquid logic:
{% raw %}
```
{% if most_recently_used_device.${platform} == 'android' %}
aifa={{most_recently_used_device.${google_ad_id}}}
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab iOS %}
For iOS, both Braze and Singular automatically collect the IDFV natively through our SDK integrations. This can be used as the device identifier. You can include the IDFV in your Singular click tracking links by utilizing the following Liquid logic:

{% raw %}
```
{% if most_recently_used_device.${platform} == 'ios' %}
idfv={{most_recently_used_device.${id}}}
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% alert note %}
**This recommendation is purely optional**<br>
If you currently do not use any device identifiers - such as the IDFV or GAID - in your click tracking links, or do not plan to in the future, Singular will still be able to attribute these clicks through their probabilistic modeling.
