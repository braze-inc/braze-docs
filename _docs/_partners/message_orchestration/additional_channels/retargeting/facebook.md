# Facebook Audience Export

Braze provides the ability to manually export your users from the Braze Segments page. This is a one-time, static audience export and will only create new Facebook Custom Audiences.

Common use cases for exporting Facebook Custom Audiences include:
- Retarget users at specific points within their lifecycle
- Create exclusion targeting lists
- [Lookalike Audiences][4] to acquire new users more efficiently
<br><br>

{% alert note %}
Facebook Audience Export uses the __User Access Token__ to authorize requests.<br><br>
If you are using this feature alongside the [Audience Sync to Facebook]({{site.baseurl}}/audience_sync_facebook/) feature (currently in Beta), Braze will default to using the more reliable __System User Token__ that you have already generated, to authorize requests.
{% endalert %}

## Prerequisites

{% raw %}
Requirement   |Origin| Description
--------------|------|-------------
Facebook Business Manager|[Facebook][1]| A centralized tool to manage your brand's Facebook assets (e.g., ad accounts, pages, apps).|
Facebook ad Account|[Facebook][2]| An active Facebook ad account tied to your brand's Business Manager that you want to use your Custom Audiences from Braze. <br><br> Please ensure that your Facebook Business Manager admin has granted you admin permissions to the Facebook ad accounts you plan to use with Braze and that you have accepted your ad account terms and conditions. Otherwise, you will not be able to access any Facebook ad accounts within Braze. |
Facebook Custom Audiences Terms|[Facebook][3]| You have accepted Facebook's Custom Audiences Terms for your Facebook ad accounts you plan to use with Braze.|

## Integration

### Connect to Facebook

In the Braze dashboard, go to __Technology Partners__ and select __Facebook__. In the Facebook Audience Export module, click __Connect Facebook__.

![Activate Facebook][6]{: style="max-width:70%;"}

A Facebook oAuth dialog window will appear to authorize Braze to create Custom Audiences into your Facebook ad accounts.

![Facebook Dialog][8]{: style="max-width:30%;"}  ![Facebook Dialog][7]{: style="max-width:40%;"}

Once you have linked Braze to your Facebook account, you will then be able to select which ad accounts you would like to sync within your Braze app group. 

![Facebook Dialog][9]{: style="max-width:70%;"}

Once you have successfully connected, you will be taken back to the partner page, where you can view which accounts are connected and disconnect existing accounts.

![Facebook Connected][10]{: style="max-width:70%;"}

Your Facebook connection will be applied at the Braze app group level. If your Facebook admin removes you from your Facebook Business Manager or access to the connected Facebook accounts, Braze will detect an invalid token. As a result, your active Canvases using Facebook Audience Steps will show errors, and Braze will not be able to sync users. 

{% alert important %}
For customers that have previously undergone the Facebook App Review process for [Ads Management](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions/#reference-ads_management) and [Ads Management Standard Access](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/access#standard), your System User Token will still be valid for the Facebook Audience Step. You will not be able to edit or revoke the Facebook System User Token through the Facebook partner page. Instead, you can connect your Facebook account to replace your Facebook System User Token within your Braze app group. 

<br><br>The new Facebook oAuth configuration will also apply to [Facebook exports via Segments]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/additional_channels/retargeting/facebook/#prerequisites). 
{% endalert %}

### Exporting Your Users into Facebook

Braze's Facebook Audience Export is accessible through the Segments page. Click on the gear next to the segment that you'd like to export. Then click on __Export as Facebook Audience__.

If you haven't already activated Facebook within Braze, it will prompt you to go to the Facebook Technology Partners page in the dashboard. If you have already activated Facebook through __Technology Partners > Facebook__, you will be able to select the user field to export, and a dropdown to select your Facebook ad account will show.

There are three possible user fields you can export:  

- Email
- Device IDFA
- Phone number

{% alert note %}
You can only select one user field within a single export. If you choose more than one data type, Braze will create a separate custom audience for each.
{% endalert %}

Once you have selected the user field, click on the __Export__ button. Similar to CSV exports, you will receive an email when the segment has finished exporting into Facebook.

You can view the custom audience on the [Facebook Ads Manager][13].

{% alert important %}
Due to user privacy reasons, Facebook doesn't allow you to see:

- Exact users that were successfully added to a Custom Audience. [Learn more.](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/112061095610075)
- Size of the Custom Audience. [Learn more.](https://marketingland.com/exclusive-facebook-will-no-longer-show-audience-reach-estimates-for-custom-audiences-after-vulnerability-detected-236923)
{% endalert %}

#### Lookalike Audiences

Once you've successfully exported a segment as a Facebook Audience, you can create additional groups using Facebook's [Lookalike Audiences][4]. This feature looks at the demographics, interests, and other attributes of your chosen audience and creates a new audience of people with similar attributes.
