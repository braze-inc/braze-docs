# Rokt Calendar

> [Rokt Calendar](https://www.rokt.com/rokt-calendar/) is a dynamic calendar marketing technology that enables brands to push 1:1 events and promotional communications in the form of calendar events and notifications.

The Braze and Rokt Calendar integration allows your Rokt Calendar subscribers and their data to be pushed to Braze via Braze webhook. You can then use this data in Braze Canvases for journey targeting and audience segmentation using any of the following custom [Rokt Calendar attributes](#audience-segmentation). 

## Prerequisites

| Requirement  | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Rokt Calendar account | A client-specific Rokt Calendar account is required to take advantage of this partnership. Contact [sales-calendar@rokt.com](mailto:sales-calendar@rokt.com) to speak with an account manager  |
| Rokt Calendar setup | Your Rokt Calendar account manager will work with you to set up the calendar to best suit your needs, including settings like:<br>- Merge flag<br>- SubscriberID fallback flag<br>- Email capture, if needed |

## Audience segmentation {#audience-segmentation}

When Rokt Calendar creates a new user or matches an existing subscriber with a Braze user, Rokt Calendar will send the following custom subscription attributes you can filter within Braze:

| Custom attribute  | Definition       | Example          |
| ----------------  | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `rokt:account_code` | Code of the Rokt Calendar account | `brazetest/f5733866ade2` and `brazetest/ff10919f1078` |

Rokt Calendar will also trigger a `subscribe` custom event as soon as the user has subscribed to your Rokt calendar that can be used either in Braze segmentation or be used as a trigger for a campaign or Canvas component.

## Integration

### Step 1: Building an audience of calendar subscribers

To send calendar events from Canvas, you must first have a Rokt calendar setup with users already subscribed. To do this, you will need to inform your users where and how to subscribe to the calendar. Rokt Calendar recommends that you:

#### Provide subscription integration points
To build an audience of calendar subscribers, you will need to offer a destination to which a user can navigate and subscribe. Some subscription integration point examples include:
  - Add a calendar button to your website
  - Adding a calendar link in an email or SMS 
  - Add  a calendar button to your app
  - Add a calendar link on social media

#### Promote the calendar
To build an audience of subscribers, you'll need to promote the calendar to your audience so that they know how to subscribe. Some calendar promotion examples include:
  - Posts on social media
  - Email newsletters and updates
  - Blog posts
  - In-app notifications

### Step 2: Create a Rokt Calendar webhook in Braze

Within Braze, you can set up a webhook campaign or a webhook within a Canvas to either:

- Send a new personalized event: Allow new events to be added to a segment of subscribers' calendars.
- Update a personalized event: Allow for an update to be made to an existing event in subscribers' calendars.

To create a Rokt Calendar webhook template to use in future campaigns or Canvases, navigate to the **Templates & Media** section in the Braze platform. If you would like to create a one-off Rokt Calendar webhook campaign or use an existing template, select **Webhook** in Braze when creating a new campaign.

{% tabs %}
{% tab Send a new event %}
Once you have selected the Rokt Calendar webhook template, you should see the following:
- **Webhook URL**: {% raw %}`{% assign accountCode = {{custom_attribute.${rokt:account_code}}}[0] | split: '/' | first %}https://api.roktcalendar.com/v1/subscriptionevent/{{accountCode}}`{% endraw %}
- **Request Body**: Raw Text
{% endtab %}
{% tab Update an existing event %}
Once you have selected the Rokt Calendar webhook template, you should see the following:
- **Webhook URL**: {% raw %}`{% assign accountCode = {{custom_attribute.${rokt:account_code}}}[0] | split: '/' | first %}https://api.roktcalendar.com/v1/subscriptionevent/{{accountCode}}/update`{% endraw %}
- **Request Body**: Raw Text
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Request headers and method

Rokt Calendar requires an `HTTP Header` for authorization that includes your Rokt Calendar Connected Content credential name. The following will already be included within the template as key-value pairs, but in the **Settings** tab, you must replace `<Rokt-Calendar-API>` with the credential name found in `Manage Settings > Connected Content > Credential`.

{% raw %}
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Request Header**:
  - **Authorization**: Bearer `{% connected_content https://api.roktcalendar.com/oauth2/token :method post :basic_auth <Rokt-Calendar-API> :body grant_type=client_credentials :save token :retry %}{{token.access_token}}`
  - **Request Body**: application/json
{% endraw %}
