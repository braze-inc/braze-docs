# Rokt Calendar

> Rokt Calendar is a dynamic calendar marketing technology that enables brands to push 1:1 events and promotional communications, in the form of calendar events and notifications, across a proprietary network of subscriber calendars.

The Rokt Calendar and Braze integration allow for Rokt Calendar calendar subscribers and associated subscription data to be pushed into Braze.

Customers can use the Braze Canvas to define journey targeting, a segment of your audience, while using the calendar event as a communication method, much in the same way that SMS, email, and push notifications are used. Audience segmentation can be done on any of the standard Braze user attributes as well as the custom attributes generated through the calendar subscription.

Rokt Calendar provides Braze customers the ability to align their personalized marketing initiatives and extend personalized content to the end user's Calendar. Thus, making it a more seamless experience for the end user and further develops stickiness with our customers' services.

In addition, Rokt will also trigger a `subscribe` custom event as soon as the user has subscribed to your Rokt calendar that can be used either in Braze segmentation or be used as a trigger for a campaign or Canvas step.

## Using Rokt Calendar in Your Braze Campaigns & Canvases

Within Braze, you can set up a webhook campaign or a webhook within a Canvas to either:

- __Send new personalized event__: This will allow new events to be added to a segment of subscribers’ calendars.
- __Update personalized event__: This will allow for an update to be made to an event that has already been added to subscribers’ calendars.

Before you get started, the fields below detail the information that can be customized at the event level.

| Field             | Definition       | Example          |

| `eventLocation` | The location of the event as it would appear in the calendar, note that this is often used as a second call to action which is complementary to the eventTitle. | Open the event to get 50% off |
