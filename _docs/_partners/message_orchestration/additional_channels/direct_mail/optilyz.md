## Use cases

Running direct mail like a digital channel means moving away from mass mailings and leveraging the channel as part of your (digital) customer journeys. The benefits of a modern approach to direct mail are:
- Increased conversion rates via increased relevance, additional use cases, easier A/B testing, and cross-channel effects
- Reduced effort via automation and an end-to-end solution
- Reduced cost via frame contracts and cost transparency

## Integration

To integrate with optilyz, use the [optilyz API][2] to send recipient data to the Braze webhook.

### Step 1: Create your Braze webhook template

To create an optilyz webhook template to use in future campaigns or Canvases, navigate to the **Templates & Media** section in the Braze platform. If you would like to create a one-off optilyz webhook campaign or use an existing template, select **Webhook** in Braze when creating a new campaign.

In your new Webhook template, fill out the following fields:
- **Webhook URL**: `https://www.optilyz.com/api/v2/automations/<OPTILYZ_AUTOMATION_ID>/recipient`
- **Request Body**: Raw Text

#### Request headers and method

optilyz also requires an HTTP Header for authorization and an HTTP method. The following will already be included within the template as a key-value pair, but in the **Settings** tab, you must replace the `<OPTILYZ_API_KEY>` with your optilyz API key. This key must include a ":" directly after the key and be encoded in base 64. 

- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Request Headers**:
  - **Authorization**: {% raw %} `{{ '<OPTILYZ_API_KEY>:' | base64_encode }}` {% endraw %}
  - **Content-Type**: application/json

#### Request body

In the following request body, you can use any Liquid personalization tags and build a custom request template according to optilyz' [API documentation][2].

The `variation` field is optional and can define which design inside the automation should be used. If a variation is omitted, optilyz will assign one of the defined variations randomly.

{% raw %}
```json
{
    "address": {
        "title": "{{custom_attribute.${salutation}}}",
        "firstName": "{{${first_name}}}",
        "lastName": "{{${last_name}}}",
        "street": "{{custom_attribute.${street}}}",
        "houseNumber": "{{custom_attribute.${houseNumber}}}",
        "address2": "{{custom_attribute.${address2}}}",
        "zipCode": "{{custom_attribute.${zipCode}}}",
        "city": "{{custom_attribute.${city}}}",
        "country": "{{custom_attribute.${country}}}"
    },
    "variation": {{custom_attribute.${designVariation}}}
}
```
{% endraw %}

### Step 2: Preview your request

Next, preview your request in the **Preview** panel or navigate to the **Test** tab, where you can select a random user, an existing user, or customize your own to test your webhook. Remember to save your template before leaving the page!
