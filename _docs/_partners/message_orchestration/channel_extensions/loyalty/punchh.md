# Punchh

> [Punchh](https://punchh.com/) is an industry-leading loyalty and engagement platform that enables brands to deliver omnichannel customer loyalty programs both in-store and digitally. 

The Braze and Punchh integration allows you to sync data for gifting and loyalty purposes across the two platforms. Data published in Braze will be available for segmentation and can sync user data back into Punchh via Braze webhooks.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
| Punchh Account | You need an active Punchh account to take advantage of this partnership. |
| Braze REST API key | A Braze REST API key with `users.track` permissions. <br><br> This can be created within the **Braze Dashboard > Developer Console > REST API Key > Create New API Key**. |
| Braze REST Endpoint | [Your REST Endpoint URL][6]. Your endpoint depends on the Braze URL for your instance. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

## Integration

Punchh offers several endpoints available to Braze customers to help add external IDs into the Punchh platform using the following Punchh API endpoints. Once the external IDs have been added, create an adapter in Punchh, provide your Braze credentials, and select which events you'd like to sync. Next, you can take the Punchh segment ID and use it to build a Punchh webhook to trigger customer syncing in a Canvas journey.

### Available Events to Sync {#available-events-to-sync}
1. Guest
2. Loyalty Check-in
3. Gift Check-in
4. Redemption
5. Rewards
6. Transaction Notifications
7. Marketing Notifications

Reference Punchh documentation on what sample payloads for these available events may look like.

### Step 1: Set up external ID ingestion endpoints

External IDs from Braze can be added using the following endpoints for new and existing Punchh users.

{% alert important %}
The `external_source` and `external_source_id` field values must be unique to Punchh and not associated with existing profiles.
{% endalert %}

1. New Punchh users<br>
Create new users in Punchh with a Punchh signup endpoint using the `external_source` and `external_source_id` fields. Punchh allows external identifiers to be sent with a user profile via one of the following signup endpoints:
- [Mobile Signup API](https://developers.punchh.com/mobile-apis/users/mobile-sign-up)
- [SSO Signup API](https://developers.punchh.com/sso-online-apis/single-sign-on/sso-signup)<br><br>
2. Existing Punchh users <br>
Update `external_source_id` for existing Punchh users. Punchh allows external identifiers to be added to a profile via a user API update endpoint: 
- [Mobile User Update](https://developers.punchh.com/mobile-apis/users/mobile-update-user-profile)
- [SSO User Update](https://developers.punchh.com/sso-online-apis/single-sign-on/sso-update-user-information)
- [Dashboard User Update](https://developers.punchh.com/platform-functions-apis/users/dashboard-users-update)
<br><br>

{% tab User signup API example %}
This example allows you to send external identifiers with a user profile at the time of signup. This is done by sending `external_source` as “customer_id” and `external_source_id` as “556644557788334412” as a string data type.

}'
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% alert note %}
Platform configuration: In order to enable external identifiers in Punchh, from the Punchh dashboard, navigate to **Cockpit > Dashboard > External User Identifier**.
{% endalert %}

### Step 2: Braze adapter setup in Punchh

To set up the Braze and Punchh integration:

1. In the Punchh dashboard, navigate to **Cockpit > Dashboard > Major Features > Enable Webhook Management** and toggle on **Enable Webhook Management**.<br><br>
2. Next, enable adapters by navigating to **Settings > Webhooks Manager > Configurations > Show Adapters Tab** and toggle on **Show Adapters Tab**.<br><br>
3. Navigate to **Webhooks Manager** under the **Settings** tab, select the **Adapters** tab, and click **Create Adapter**. <br><br>![][1]<br><br>
4. Fill in the adapter name, description, and admin email. Select **Braze** as your adapter and provide your Braze REST API endpoint and Braze API key.<br><br>
5. Next, select the available events you would like to enable. A list of these events can be found in [Available events to sync](#available-events-to-sync).<br><br>![][3]<br><br>
6. Click **Submit** to enable the webhook.

### Step 3: Create Punchh webhook in Braze

The Braze and Punchh integration allows you to leverage Braze webhook capabilities to create Punchh segments:

1. Create a custom segment in Punchh and note the `custom_segment_id` present in the Punchh segment dashboard URL. <br><br>For example, the following page is located at `www.dashboard.punchhtest.com/segments/11646`. The number "11646" at the end of this link is the `custom_segment_id`.<br><br>![][5]<br><br>
2. Create a webhook campaign in Braze using the Punchh endpoint for adding a user to a custom segment as the webhook URL. Here, you can provide the `custom_segment_id` and `user_id` as key-value pairs.<br><br>![][4]<br><br>
3. Once the webhook is saved, it can be triggered in Canvas to sync users as shown in the following image:<br><br>![An example of syncing users using the saved webhook as a result of Braze and Punchh integration.][7]
