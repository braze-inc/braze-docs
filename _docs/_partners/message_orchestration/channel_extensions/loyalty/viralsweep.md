The Braze and ViralSweep integration allows you to hold sweepstakes and contests on the ViralSweep platform (growing your email and SMS lists) and then send sweepstakes or contest entry information into Braze to use in campaigns or Canvases.

## Frequently asked questions

### What fields does ViralSweep pass to Braze?
- First name
- Last name
- Email address
- Address
- Address 2
- City
- State
- Zip
- Country
- Birthdate
- Phone
- Promotion ID
- Referral link
- Tracking campaign name

### Does ViralSweep update subscribers?
Yes. If you run a promotion and ViralSweep passes someone to Braze, and then you run another promotion later, and the same person enters, ViralSweep will automatically update their information in Braze (if any new information is provided). The referral URL will also be updated with the newest URL for each promotion they enter.

## Troubleshooting

If you have connected to Braze and data is not being added to your account, it may be because:

- **Email already exists in Braze**<br>
The email address entered into the promotion may already be in your Braze account, so it will not be added again; it will only be updated if new information is provided for that contact.<br><br>
- **Email already entered into ViralSweep**<br>
The email address entered into the promotion has already been entered previously, so it is not passed to Braze again. This can happen if you set up your Braze integration after you have already entered the promotion.
