## Use cases

The following use cases showcase a few ways to leverage Extole’s integration with Braze. Work with your Extole implementation and customer success managers to develop an option that fits your company’s specific needs.

- Leverage custom events from your referral and engagement programs to trigger a Braze campaign or Canvas
- Create custom segments, dashboards, and reporting using data from your Extole-powered programs
- Automatically unsubscribe or subscribe users to your marketing list in Braze

## Integration

Complete the following steps to quickly get your integration up and running. Your Extole implementation and customer success managers will support you through this process and answer any questions you may have.

### Connect to your Braze account

1. Select the Braze integration on the [Partners](https://my.extole.com/partners) page of your My Extole account.
2. In the Braze integration, select **Install** to initiate the connection between Extole and Braze.
3. Fill out the required fields, starting with your Braze REST API key. 
4. Enter your Braze API URL. This URL depends on which instance your Braze account is provisioned to.
5. Add any Extole events you'd like to send to Braze. The default events, event properties, and user attributes are described in the [Extole Events table](https://dev.extole.com/docs/braze#extole-program-events).
6. Add any reward states you'd like to send to Braze other than the `FULFILLED` state. Refer to the [Extole Rewards table](https://dev.extole.com/docs/braze#extole-rewards) for descriptions of the available reward states.
7. Select your Braze external ID key mapping. This is how Extole updates user profiles in Braze. You can map the Braze external ID key to Extole's `email_address` or `partner_user_id` for the user. We recommend using `external_id` instead of `email_address` as it is more secure.
8. Save your settings to complete the connection. Now, Extole events can flow to your Braze account.

### Extole rewards

By default, Extole will send reward events in the `FULFILLED` state to Braze so you can trigger reward notifications via a Braze campaign or Canvas. Refer to the following table for additional reward states.

| Reward State | Description | Event Properties | User Attributes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `FULFILLED` | The default state. The reward has been assigned a value (such as coupon or gift card) by an Extole reward supplier. | Email <br>Face value  <br>Coupon code  <br>Face value type  | Email <br>First name  <br>Last name |

## Customization

### Find and create users in Braze

For certain use cases, such as a new email or SMS subscription where Extole does not have an external ID (user ID), Extole can check for the user's identifier using the Braze [Export user profile by identifier endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/export/user_data/post_users_identifier/). Extole will add and update any profile attributes if the user exists in Braze. If the request does not return a user profile, Extole will use the `/users/track` endpoint to create a user alias with the user's email address as the alias name.

## Using this integration

After connecting your accounts, events will automatically begin flowing from Extole to Braze without any action on your part. A live view of events being sent to Braze can be found in Extole’s Outbound Webhook Center for troubleshooting.
