## Use cases

The following use cases showcase a few ways you can leverage Extole's integration with Braze. Work with your Extole implementation and customer success managers to develop an option that fits your company's specific needs.

## Integration

Complete the following steps to get your integration up and running quickly. Your Extole implementation and customer success managers will support you through this process.

### Step 1: Define event names and attributes 

Any event that Extole tracks can be sent to Braze. Work with your Extole implementation or client success manager to identify the event names and user attributes you'd like to send into Braze or select from the default options in the tables below. Your Extole implementation or client success manager will then map and configure the event names in the Extole dashboard.

#### Event names

| Event name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Created Share Link | A share link is created for a customer. |
| Shared | A customer sends a link to their friend(s) via email, SMS, or social channel. |
| Referred Signed Up | A referred customer signs up via email or SMS through the program. |
| Referred Converted | A referred customer completes a purchase. Note that outcome events can be customized for your business.|
| Subscribed | A customer subscribes via email or SMS. |
| Unsubscribed | A customer unsubscribes via email or SMS. |
| Earned Reward | A customer earns a reward. |

#### Attribute names

| Attribute name | Description | Example | 
| -------------- | ----- | ------- |
| `external_id` (required) | The unique identifier for the customer, such as a user ID. | User ID |
| `email` | The customer's email address. | jsmith@yourcompany.com |
| `phone_number` | The customer's phone number, including country code. | +15555555555 |

### Step 2: Connect to your Braze account 

To start sending data from your Extole programs into Braze, create a new webhook integration in Extole's outbound webhook center.


1. Navigate to **Tech Center > Outbound Webhooks** in your My Extole account and click on the **+ New Integration** button.
2. Enter a key name (i.e., how you'd like to refer to the key in Extole) and select **Webhook** as the key type. 
3. In the partner key ID field, add a value that you will recognize for this credential (e.g., your account ID, email address, or user ID).
4. Select `PASSWORD` from the algorithm drop-down.
5. Add your Braze REST API key to the key field and click **Create Key**.<br><br>![][4]{: style="max-width:80%;"}

Next, work with your Extole success or implementation manager to create a new webhook. They will configure the webhook for you using your newly generated key and Braze instance URL.<br><br>![][5]{: style="max-width:80%;"}

## Customization

### Configure a staging API key for testing

If you only provide one Braze REST API key to Extole, only production events will be sent to Braze. If you also want to send staging or testing events, create another Braze REST API key and configure an additional webhook integration in the Extole dashboard.

### Creating a new user alias

For certain use cases, such as a new email or SMS subscription where Extole does not have an external ID (user ID) for the user, Extole can check for the user's identifier using Braze's [export user by identifier endpoint][2]. If the user exists within Braze, Extole will add and update any profile attributes. If the request does not return a user profile, Extole will instead use the [user track endpoint][3] to create a user alias with the user's email address as the alias name.

## Using this integration

After connecting your Braze account to the Extole dashboard, events will automatically begin flowing from Extole to Braze. A live view of events being sent to Braze can be found in Extole's outbound webhook center for troubleshooting.

Once the events and attributes you have configured are flowing into Braze, you can use the data to generate Braze audiences and campaign segmentation.
