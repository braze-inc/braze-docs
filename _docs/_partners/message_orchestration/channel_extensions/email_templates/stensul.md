# Stensul

[Stensul](https://stensul.com/) empowers email marketers to easily create mobile-responsive emails across channels, at scale.

Build responsive, on-brand emails in Stensul before sending them downstream to Braze, in real-time, for segmentation and targeting.

## Requirements

Requirement   | Source | Description
--------------|--------| -----
Braze API Key | [Braze Platform](https://dashboard.braze.com/sign_in) | The API key must have the *Template's* permission enabled before use.

## Integration

The export functionality from Stensul to Braze will allow users to send your HTML-formatted email as a new template within the Braze platform.

Braze is integrated directly into the Stensul platform. Thus, after providing your Stensul Customer Success team with your Braze API key and cluster instance, the integration will be set up for you, allowing you to push your completed email from Stensul to Braze as outlined below.

### Step 1
Once the email is created in Stensul, click **Complete**.
![Stensul Save Options]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/stensul_save_options.png %})

### Step 2
Select the **Upload to ESP** option on the Completion page, as shown below.
![Stensul Upload Options]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/stensul_upload_options.png %})

### Step 3
Enter the `template name`, `subject`, and `preheader` for your email. Then, select **Upload**. You will then receive a confirmation that the upload was successful and a history of past uploads of the file if applicable.

## Usage
To use this integration, look for your new email template in [Templates & Media > Email Templates][1] in your Braze account, or begin to create your email and choose your template from those presented.
