## Integration

The Braze and Dyspatch integration lets you export Dyspatch email templates directly into your Braze media library or download your template and manually upload it. 

### Step 1: Create the Braze integration

In the Dyspatch administration portal, open your username drop-down menu and select **Integrations**. Create a new integration, select **Braze**, and enter your Braze API key.

In the **Localize Exports By** field, you can choose how you would like to manage localizations. This field allows you to [localize your email templates][6] and export them to Braze to easily send emails personalized by language or locale. 

![Dyspatch Export Template]({% image_buster /assets/img/dyspatch/dyspatch_integration_create.png %}){: style="max-width:50%;"}

### Step 2: Export template to Braze

After completing an email in Dyspatch, to send your template to Braze, view the published email template and click **Download/Export** and then **Export to Integration**.

If you want to upload your template manually, view the published email template and  click **Download/Export** and then **Download HTML**. Next, in the **Templates & Media > Email Templates** section of your Braze account, select **From File** to upload your template.

![Dyspatch Export Template]({% image_buster /assets/img/dyspatch/dyspatch_export.gif %})

{% alert important %}
Do not select **Inline CSS** in the **Sending Info** section for any Dyspatch email template in Braze. Dyspatch takes care of this by making sure your emails are robust, responsive, and ready to send.
{% endalert %}

### Usage

Find your uploaded Dyspatch template in your Braze account's **Templates & Media > Email Templates** section. You can now use this email template to start sending engaging email messages to your customers!
