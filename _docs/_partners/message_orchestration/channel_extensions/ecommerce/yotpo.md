# Yotpo

> [Yotpo](https://www.yotpo.com/), the leading eCommerce marketing platform, helps thousands of forward-thinking brands accelerate direct-to-consumer growth. Yotpo's single-platform approach integrates data-driven solutions for reviews, loyalty, SMS marketing, and more, empowering brands to create smarter, higher-converting customer experiences.

With the Braze and Yotpo integration, you can dynamically pull and display star ratings, top reviews, and visual user-generated content (UGC) on products within emails and other communication channels within Braze. You can also include customer-level loyalty data in emails and other communication methods to create a more personalized interaction, boosting sales and loyalty.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Yotpo account | A Yotpo account is required to take advantage of this partnership. |
| Yotpo reviews API key | This API will be implemented within the Connected Content code snippet.<br><br>For more information, refer to [finding your Yotpo app key and secret key](https://support.yotpo.com/en/article/finding-your-yotpo-app-key-and-secret-key). |
| Yotpo loyalty API key | This API key and GUID will be implemented within the Connected Content code snippet.<br><br>For more information, refer to [finding your loyalty & referrals API key and GUID](https://support.yotpo.com/en/article/finding-your-loyalty-referrals-api-key-and-guid)|
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

Before continuing, confirm that the Yotpo product ID is the same as the `product_id` that will be pulled dynamically from Braze. This is mandatory for the integration to work. 

To find your Yotpo product ID, perform the following steps:

1. Go to your store website.
2. Open the product page.
3. Right-click and select **Inspect**.
4. Press <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> and search for `yotpo-main` in the code. The `data-product ID` variable and its value appear in the Yotpo div.

## Integration

To integrate Yotpo and Braze, perform the following steps:

1. Go to your Braze dashboard.
2. On the **Campaigns** page, click **Create Campaign** and select **Email**.
3. Select your preferred template.
4. Click **Edit email body** and add the respective [Connected Content]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/connected_content/) snippet for your use case:
    - [Display a product's star rating and review count](#star-review-count)
    - [Display a recent 5-star review for a product](#five-star-review)
    - [Display visual UGC by product](#visual-ugc)
    - [Display a customer's loyalty balance in an email](#loyalty-balance)

### Display a product's star rating and review count {#star-review-count}

Use this snippet to provide the public average score and number of total reviews for a product that is included in the email:

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% connected_content https://api.yotpo.com/products/<YOTPO-API-KEY>/{{event_properties.${product_id}}}/bottomline :save result %}      

{% if {{result.response.bottomline.average_score}} != 0 %}

The average rating for this product is:

{{result.response.bottomline.average_score}}/5, based on {{result.response.bottomline.total_reviews}} reviews.

{% else %}                    
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

Replace `<YOTPO-API-KEY>` with your Yotpo reviews API key. The `product_id` will be pulled dynamically from Braze. For the integration to work, the `product_id` in Braze must match the product ID in Yotpo (typically the eCommerce parent product ID).

![Replace YOTPO-API-KEY with your Yotpo Reviews API key][2]

### Display a recent 5-star review for a product {#five-star-review}

Use this snippet to provide a top (published) review for a specific product that is included in the email:

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% connected_content https://api.yotpo.com/v1/widget/<YOTPO-API-KEY>/products/{{event_properties.${product_id}}}/reviews.json?per_page=50&star=5&sort=votes_up :save result %}

{% if {{result.response.reviews[0].score}} == 5 %}

Recent 5 Star Review for this product:

{{result.response.reviews[0].content}}

{% else %}              
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

Replace `<YOTPO-API-KEY>` with your Yotpo reviews API key. The `product_id` will be pulled dynamically from Braze. For the integration to work, the `product_id` in Braze must match the product ID in Yotpo (typically the eCommerce parent product ID).

Here's what the snippet in your email editor will look like:

### Display visual UGC by product {#visual-ugc}

Use this snippet to retrieve tagged and published Yotpo images and add them to your emails instead of the stock image or as an additional gallery:

{% raw %}
```liquid

{% connected_content https://api.yotpo.com/v1/widget/<YOTPO-API-KEY>/albums/product/{{event_properties.${product_id}}}?per_page=1 :save result %}

{% if {{result.response.images[0].tagged_products[0].image_url}} != null %}

The Visual content of the product: 

<img src="{{result.response.images[0].tagged_products[0].image_url}}" border="0" width="200" height="200" alt="" />

{% else %}

Image return NULL

{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

Replace `<YOTPO-API-KEY>` with your Yotpo reviews API key. The `product_id` will be pulled dynamically from Braze. For the integration to work, the `product_id` in Braze must match the product ID in Yotpo (typically the eCommerce parent product ID).

The snippet will look something like this:

![Example of email editor showing a snippet of images published in Yotpo][4]

### Display a customer's loyalty balance in an email {#loyalty-balance}

Use this snippet to retrieve a customer's loyalty point balance and use it in your email messaging:

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% connected_content 

https://loyalty.yotpo.com/api/v2/customers?customer_email=**{{${email_address}}}**
:method get
:headers {
    "x-guid": "<YOTPO-LOYALTY-GUID>",
    "x-api-key": "<YOTPO-LOYALTY-API-KEY>"
        }
:content_type application/json
:save publication
%}

You have {{publication.points_balance}} points

Only {{publication.vip_tier_upgrade_requirements.points_needed}} more points to become part of our VIP Tier!
```
{% endraw %}

Replace `<YOTPO-LOYALTY-GUID>` and `<YOTPO-LOYALTY-API-KEY>` with your Yotpo loyalty credentials. The `email_address` is pulled dynamically from Braze. For the integration to work, the email must be the email address of the customer receiving the email.

The snippet will look something like this:
