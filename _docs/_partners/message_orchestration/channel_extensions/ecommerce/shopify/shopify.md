# Shopify overview

> [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) is a leading global commerce company providing trusted tools to start, grow, market, and manage a retail business of any size. Shopify makes commerce better for everyone with a platform and services engineered for reliability while delivering a better shopping experience for consumers everywhere. 

The Shopify and Braze integration allows brands to connect their Shopify store seamlessly to pass select Shopify events and customers into Braze. Leverage Braze's cross-channel strategies and Canvas to engage new leads, message new customers, or retarget your users with abandoned checkout messaging to nudge them to complete their purchase

## Prerequisites

All Braze customers looking to utilize the Shopify integration must sign Braze's Shopify order form. Reach out to your account executive for more details.

This integration will create alias user profiles if we are unable to match Shopify data using the email or phone number ([see here for more details on Shopify user reconciliation]({{site.baseurl}}/shopify_processing/#shopify-user-syncing)). Consult with your development teams around the downstream impacts and need to merge these user profiles as part of your user lifecycle before you enable the integration.

#### Web SDK integration via Shopify ScriptTag (optional)

Braze also allows you to embed our [Web SDK integration]({{site.baseurl}}/scripttag_web_sdk_integration/) via ScriptTag on to your Shopify store. This integration requires the above [prerequisites](#prerequisites), as well as the ones found on the [ScriptTag]({{site.baseurl}}/scripttag_web_sdk_integration/#prerequisites) integration page.

Embedding our Web SDK via ScriptTag supports tracking the following:
  - [Anonymous user tracking]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/user_data_collection/user_profile_lifecycle/#anonymous-user-profiles) to track guest activity in your store
  - [Monthly active user]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/analytics/understanding_your_app_usage_data/#monthly-active-users) tracking as the Web SDK is capable of tracking session data from your store visitors
  - Option to collect Shopify on-site activity users which will count toward your [data point]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/onboarding_with_braze/data_points#data-points) consumption
  - Option to enable [in-browser messaging]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/about/) as a channel on your Shopify store
