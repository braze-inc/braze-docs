# Shopify

> [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) is a leading global commerce company providing trusted tools to start, grow, market, and manage a retail business of any size. Shopify makes commerce better for everyone with a platform and services engineered for reliability while delivering a better shopping experience for consumers everywhere. 

The Shopify and Braze integration allow brands to connect their Shopify store seamlessly to pass select Shopify webhooks into Braze. Leverage Braze's cross-channel strategies and Canvas to retarget your users with abandoned checkout messaging to nudge customers to complete their purchase or retarget users based on their previous purchases. 

<!--
For some Canvas and Campaign examples, check out our guide here. 
-->

## Prerequisites

All Braze customers looking to utilize the Shopify integration must sign Braze's Shopify order form. Reach out to your account executive for more details.

This integration will create alias user profiles if we are unable to match Shopify data using the email or phone number ([see here for more details on Shopify user reconciliation](#shopify-user-syncing)). Consult with your development teams around the downstream impacts and need to merge these user profiles as part of your user lifecycle before you enable the integration. 

| Requirement | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Shopify store | You must have an active [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) store.<br><br>Note that at this time, you are only able to connect one Shopify store per app group. |
| Event property segmentation enabled | To ensure you can segment your Shopify events properties, you must work with your customer success manager or [Braze support]({{site.baseurl}}/braze_support/) to confirm that you have event property segmentation enabled for your dashboard. |
| Nested custom attribute support | This will be enabled with the Spotify integration.<br><br>You will be given access to this feature to receive Shopify marketing opt-in custom attributes. |

## Integration

With Braze's turnkey Shopify integration, you can:
- Seamlessly connect your Shopify store within Braze
- Allow Braze to ingest and process Shopify user data
- Sync Shopify user profiles into Braze

### Step 1: Locate Shopify within the dashboard
In Braze, go to the **Technology Partners** section and then search **Shopify**. On the Shopify partner page, select **Begin Setup** to start the integration process.

![Data Import and Web SDK Installation section of the Shopify partner page in Braze.][2]{: style="max-width:80%;"}

### Step 2: Shopify setup
Next, you are prompted by Braze's setup wizard. Within this flow, you must enter your **Shopify Store Name**, review the **Shopify Webhook Events** (ingestion begins once the integration is connected), and visit the Shopify marketplace to download Braze's unlisted Shopify app. Once you select **Install Unlisted App**, you will be redirected to the Braze dashboard.

#### Shopify setup within Braze
<br>![Workflow of setting up Shopify within Braze by entering the store name and navigating to Shopify to install the Braze app.][3]{: style="max-width:80%;"}

#### Install Braze's Shopify application
<br>![Shopify app installation page, which lists the permissions the Braze app will have after installing.][7]{: style="max-width:60%;"}

### Step 3: Verify completion
That's it! The status of your integration appears in the **Data Import** section of the Shopify partner page. Once the Braze app has been successfully installed, and the webhook creation is complete, you will be notified via email. In addition, the **Connection Pending** status will be updated to **Connected** and will display the timestamp of when the connection was established.

![Data Import section showing connection pending and setup status pending.][8]{: style="max-width:80%;"}
![][4]{: style="max-width:80%;border:0;margin-bottom:5px;"}
![Data Import section showing connection pending and setup status successful.][9]{: style="max-width:80%;"}
![][4]{: style="max-width:80%;border:0;margin-bottom:5px;"}
![Data Import section showing successful connection. A timestamp displays when the connection was established, and there is a link to the connected storefront.][10]{: style="max-width:80%;"}

## Shopify data processing

Once the app installation is complete, Braze automatically creates your webhook integration with Shopify. See the following table for more details on how the supported Shopify webhook events map to Braze custom events and custom attributes.

### Supported Shopify events

#### Supported Shopify standard attributes

- Email
- First Name
- Last Name
- Phone
- City
- Country

{% alert note %}
Braze will only update supported Shopify custom attributes, and Braze standard attributes if there is a difference in data from the existing user profile. For example, if the inbound Shopify data contains a first name of Bob and Bob already exists as a first name on the Braze user profile, Braze will not trigger an update, and the customer will not be charged a data point.
{% endalert %}

## Shopify user syncing

Braze will map the supported Shopify data to user profiles using the customer's email address or phone number. 

**Identified User Profiles**<br>
- If the email address or phone number is associated with an [identified user profile]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/user_data_collection/user_profile_lifecycle/#identified-user-profiles), Braze syncs the Shopify data to that user.
- If the email address or phone number is associated with multiple identified user profiles, Braze syncs the Shopify data to the one with the most recent activity.

**Anonymous Users**<br>
- If the email address or phone number is associated with an existing anonymous user profile or alias-only profile, we sync the Shopify data to that user. 
  - For existing alias-only profiles, we'll add the Shopify alias object for that user.
- If the email address or phone number is **not** associated with a user profile in Braze, Braze generates an alias-only user with a Shopify alias object. 
  - If these alias-only users eventually become identified, Braze customers must assign an external ID to the alias-only profile by calling the [Users Identify endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_identify/). 

## Using Shopify data in Braze
Once you've completed your integration, take a look at our next Shopify [article]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/ecommerce/shopify/use_cases/) to learn how to use Shopify data in Braze for personalization and segmentation in your campaigns and Canvases.

## Shopify advanced settings

### Update abandoned checkout delay

By default, Braze will automatically set the delay to trigger the `shopify_abandoned_checkout` event to one hour of inactivity. You can set the **Abandoned Checkout Delay** from 5 minutes up to 24 hours by selecting the dropdown and then selecting **Set Delay** on the Shopify partner page.

### Set your preferred product identifier

If you have included Braze purchase events within your Shopify integration setup, by default Braze will set the Shopify Product ID as the Product ID used within Brazeâ€™s purchase event. This will then be used when you filter for products purchased in Y days, or when personalizing content in your message using Liquid.

You can also choose to set either the SKU or Product Title from Shopify instead of the Shopify Product ID through advanced settings.
