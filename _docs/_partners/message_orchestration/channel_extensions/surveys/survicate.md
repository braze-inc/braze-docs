> [Survicate][1] is a customer feedback platform that helps you collect, analyze, and act on customer insights across multiple channels and throughout the user journey.  

With the Braze and Survicate integration, you can embed surveys directly in your Braze emails to increase response rates. Survey responses sync automatically with Braze user profiles as custom attributes or events. Real-time insights make it easy to track and analyze feedback alongside customer data and create targeted follow-ups.

## Use cases

Braze and Survicate work together to cover a range of feedback use cases, helping you collect actionable user insights and improve the customer experience:

- Measure customer satisfaction (such as CSAT, NPS, or CES)
- Collect product feedback
- Conduct user or market research
- Gather insights at critical stages of the customer journey
- Trigger personalized workflows and automate follow-up campaigns based on customer feedback

## Key features of the integration

The Survicate and Braze integration offers real-time data syncing, so the most up-to-date information from Survicate surveys is immediately available in Braze. Based on survey responses, you can use this data to take timely, personalized actions.

- **Send survey responses to Braze as custom user attributes**: Enrich Braze user profiles with data from survey responses.
- **Trigger custom events in Braze**: Use events based on survey answers to target specific groups or initiate follow-up campaigns.
