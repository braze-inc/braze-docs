# Digioh

> [Digioh](https://www.digioh.com/) helps you grow your lists, capture first-party data, and put your data to use in your Braze campaigns.

The Braze and Digioh integration allows you to use their flexible drag-and-drop builder to create on-brand forms, pop-ups, performance centers, landing pages, and surveys that connect you with your customers. Digioh will aid in integration set up and help build, design, and launch your first campaign for you.

## Integration 

To integrate Digioh, you must first configure the Braze connector. Once completed, you will need to apply the integration to a lightbox (widget). Visit [Digioh](https://help.digioh.com/knowledgebase/digioh-integration-basics/) to read more about integration basics.

### Step 1: Create Digioh integration 

In Digioh, click the **Integrations** tab and then the **New Integration** button. Select **Braze** from the **Integration** dropdown and name the integration.

Next, enter the Braze REST API key and your Braze API `/users/track/` endpoint. 

Lastly, use the map fields section to map additional custom fields beyond email and name. The following code snippet shows an example payload. Once completed, select **Create Integration**.

```json
{
    "attributes" : [
         {
           "external_id": "[EMAIL_MD5]",
           "email" : "[EMAIL]"
         }
     ]
}
```

### Step 2: Create a Digioh lightbox

Use the Digioh [design editor](https://help.digioh.com/knowledgebase/digioh-platform-training-videos-video-series-getting-started-with-digioh/) to build a lightbox (widget). <br>

### Step 3: Apply integration

To apply this integration to a Digioh [lightbox](https://help.digioh.com/knowledgebase/digioh-platform-training-videos-video-series-getting-started-with-digioh/), navigate to the **Boxes** page and select **Add** or **Edit** link in the **Integrations** column. This can also be added from the **Integration** section of the editor.
