# Typeform

> [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) is an easy-to-use tool for collecting data, feedback, and more.

By integrating Braze and Typeform, you can:

- Update user profiles in Braze with data collected from their Typeform response
- Trigger messaging in Braze based on a user’s engagement with a typeform
- Personalize Braze messaging based on a user’s Typeform responses

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Typeform account | A Typeform account with access to webhooks is required to take advantage of this partnership. |
| Braze Data Transformation | A [Data Transformation URL]({{site.baseurl}}/data_transformation/) is necessary to receive data from Typeform. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation" }

## Integration

### Step 1: Set up the Braze Data Transformation to accept Typeform's webhooks {#step-1}

{% multi_lang_include create_transformation.md location="typeform" %}

### Step 2: Set up Typeform webhooks

Follow the steps in [Typeform's webhooks documentation](https://www.typeform.com/help/a/webhooks-360029573471/) to set up a webhook.

For step 4, add your Data Transformation webhook URL as the **Destination URL**

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/typeform/typeform_add_webhook.png %}){: style="max-width:50%" }

Send a test event to your Data Transformation by clicking **View deliveries** and then **Send test request**.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/typeform/typeform_test_request.png %})

### Step 3: Write transformation code to accept your chosen Typeform events

In this step, you will transform the webhook payload that will be sent from Typeform to a JavaScript object return value.

1. Refresh your Data Transformation and make sure you can see the Typeform test payload in the **Webhook Details**.
2. Update your Data Transformation code to support your chosen Typeform events.
3. Click **Validate** to return a preview of your code’s output and to check if it’s an acceptable `/users/track` request.
4. Save and activate your Data Transformation.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/typeform/typeform_test_result.png %})

#### Request body format

This return value must adhere to Braze’s `/users/track` request body format:

- Transformation code is accepted in the JavaScript programming language. Any standard JavaScript control flow, such as if/else logic, is supported.
- Transformation code accesses the webhook request body via the payload variable. This variable is an object populated by parsing the request body JSON.
- Any feature supported in our `/users/track` endpoint is supported, including:
    - User attributes objects, event objects, and purchase objects
    - Nested attributes and nested custom event properties
    - Subscription group updates
    - Email address as an identifier

## Example Typeform webhook payload

## Data Transformation use cases

The following are example templates built using our [example Typeform webhook payload](#example-typeform-webhook-payload). These templates can be used as a starting point. You can start from scratch or delete specific components as you see fit.

In these example templates, we are logging a custom event to the Braze profile. The title of the Typeform will be passed as the custom event name, and the Typeform results will be passed as event properties. These example templates do not account for the Calendly, File Upload, or Payment question types in Typeform.

### Use case: Email as identifier

In this example template, we are using an email address (captured from an email address question within the typeform) as the identifier.

{% alert note %}
If you intend to use an email address as an identifier, review our [frequently asked questions]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track#frequently-asked-questions) for the `/users/track` endpoint for more information on expected behavior.
{% endalert %}

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Input %}

```javascript
/* In the Typeform webhook payload each question is stored as a “title” within each object of the “fields” array. Our code defines a “title” variable where we store the value of each field title. */
const titles = payload.form_response.definition.fields.map(field => field.title);

/* The answers array is saved to a “tfAnswers” variable so this can be iterated through */
const tfAnswers = payload.form_response.answers;

/* The value of a response will change based on the type of question, to account for this we have created a function that iterates through the answers, determines what the answer type is and then, based on the type, adds the associated response to an extractedValues array. */
const extractValues = (tfAnswers) => {
	const extractedValues = [];

	tfAnswers.forEach((tfAnswer) => {
		let result = null;

		if (tfAnswer.type === 'choices') {
			if (tfAnswer.choices) {
				// Multiple choices
				let labels = tfAnswer.choices.labels || [];
				if (tfAnswer.choices.other) {
					labels.push(tfAnswer.choices.other);
				}
				result = labels;
			}
		} else if (tfAnswer.type === 'choice' && Object.keys(tfAnswer.choice).length > 1) {
			// Single choice
			result = tfAnswer.choice && tfAnswer.choice.other ?
				tfAnswer.choice.other.toString() :
				tfAnswer.choice.label.toString();
		} else if (tfAnswer.type === 'dropdown') {
			// Dropdown
			result = tfAnswer.text;
		} else {
			// For other types, use the type-specific value
			result = tfAnswer[tfAnswer.type];
		}

		extractedValues.push(result);
	});

	return extractedValues;
};

/* We use the above defined function, passing it the “tfAnswers” variable that holds the answers portion of the Typeform webhook payload and save the output to a ”values” variable */
const values = extractValues(tfAnswers);

/* Finally, the values within the previously assigned “titles” variable and “values” variable are paired together in an object as the values to a “question” key and “answer” key in a “responses” array of objects variable. */
const results = titles.map((title, index) => {
	return {
		question: title,
		answer: values[index],
	};
});

/* The code defines a variable, "brazecall", to build a /users/track request. Within the request, the typeform title is populated as the event name, and our “results” variable (where all of our question/answer pairs are stored), is assigned as the event’s properties. */
let brazecall = {
	"events": [{
		"email": payload.form_response.answers.find(answer => answer.type === 'email').email,
		"name": payload.form_response.definition.title,
		"time": new Date().toISOString(),
		"properties": {
			"responses": results
		}
	}]
};

// After the /users/track request is assigned to brazecall, you will want to explicitly return “brazecall” to create an output
return brazecall;
```

          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Use case: Using identifier passed in Hidden Fields

You can use Typeform Hidden Fields to pass data in the Typeform webhook payload, such as a user's ID, without having to pass this information in the Typeform response.

In this example template, we are using a "user_id" Hidden Field and passing this into the `/users/track` request payload as the `external_id`. Although we are using "user_id", the fields can be modified to suit your needs.

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Input %}

```javascript
/* In the Typeform webhook payload each question is stored as a “title” within each object of the “fields” array. Our code defines a “title” variable where we store the value of each field title. */
const titles = payload.form_response.definition.fields.map(field => field.title);

/* The answers array is saved to a “tfAnswers” variable so this can be iterated through */
const tfAnswers = payload.form_response.answers;

/* The value of a response will change based on the type of question, to account for this we have created a function that iterates through the answers, determines what the answer type is and then, based on the type, adds the associated response to an extractedValues array. */
const extractValues = (tfAnswers) => {
	const extractedValues = [];

### Step 4: Publish your Typeform webhook

After you have written your data transformation, click **Validate** to make your Data Transformation code is formatted correctly and will work as expected. Then, save and activate your Data Transformation.

Once activated, custom event data will be logged to a user's profile when they complete your form.
