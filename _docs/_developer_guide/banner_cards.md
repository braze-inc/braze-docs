# Banner Cards

> With Banner Cards, you can create personalized messaging for your users all while extending the reach of your other channels, such as email or push notifications.

## Use cases

Because Banner Cards never expire and are auto-personalized every time a user starts a new session, they’re great for:

## About Banner Cards

### Card expiration

By default, Banner Cards don't expire&#8212;however, you can choose an end date if needed.

### Placement IDs {#placement-ids}

Banner Card placements are unique to each workspace and can be used across 10 campaigns within a single workspace. Additionally, placements within each workspace must be assigned a unique ID. You'll create placements and assign them IDs when you [create a Banner Card campaign]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/banner_cards/creating_campaigns/) or [embed Banner Cards into your app]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/banner_cards/embedding_cards/).

{% alert important %}
Avoid modifying placement IDs after launching a Banner Card campaign.
{% endalert %}

### Card priority {#card-priority}

When multiple campaigns reference the same placement ID, cards are displayed in order of priority level. By default, newly-created Banner Cards are set to medium, but you can [manually set the priority]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/banner_cards/creating_banner_cards/#set-card-priority) to high, medium, or low. If multiple cards share the same priority level, the newest card will be displayed first.

### Metrics

These are the most important Banner Card metrics. For a full list of metrics, definitions, and calculations, refer to [Report Metrics Glossary]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/report_metrics/).
