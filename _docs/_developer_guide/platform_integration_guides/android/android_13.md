# Android 13 SDK upgrade guide

This guide describes relevant changes introduced in Android 13 (2022) and the required upgrade steps for your Braze Android SDK integration.

![A graphic showing the anticipated release timeline for Android 13 with the final release being sometime after July 2022.]({% image_buster /assets/img/android/android_13_timeline.png %}){: style="max-width:70%;border:0"}

Refer to the [Android 13 developer documentation][2] for a full migration guide.

## Changes in Android 13

### Push permission {#push-permission}

Android 13 introduces a [major change][3] in how users manage apps that send push notifications. In Android 13, apps will be required to obtain permission before push notifications can be shown. 

![An Android push message asking "Allow Kitchenerie to send you notifications?" with two buttons "Allow" and "Don't allow" at the bottom of the message.]({% image_buster /assets/img/android/android-13-push-prompt.png %}){: style="float:right;max-width:430px;width:50%;margin-left:15px;border:0"}

This new permission follows a similar pattern to iOS and Web push, where you only have one attempt to obtain permission. If a user declines push (explicitly or by clicking outside of the prompt), your app cannot ask for permission again.

Note that apps are granted a [temporary exemption][4] intended for users who previously had push notifications for that app enabled prior to updating to Android 13. These users will remain eligible to receive push from the app until (A) they explicitly decline the permission prompt when it's shown (or within system settings), or (B) the app is opened for the first time after a user upgrades to Android 13.

#### Permission prompt timing {#push-permission-timing}

**Targeting Android 13**

Apps targeting Android 13 can control when to request permission and show the native push prompt. If your user upgrades from Android 12 to 13, your app was previously installed, and you were already sending push, you'll have [temporary permission][4] to show notifications until the user opens your app again after upgrading the device.

**Targeting Android 12 or earlier**

If your app does not yet target Android 13, then once a user upgrades to Android 13, they will automatically see a push permission prompt when your app creates its first notification channel (via `notificationManager.createNotificationChannel`). 

{% alert note %}
Braze automatically creates a default notification channel if one does not already exist when a push notification is received. If you don't target Android 13, this will cause the push permission prompt to be shown, which is required to show the notification.
{% endalert %}

## Preparing for Android 13 {#next-steps}

This guide will continue to update as new Android 13 beta versions are released. Check back here for updates related to Braze compatibility with Android 13.

We strongly recommend that you prepare an Android 13 compatible build in time for the [Android 13 platform stability milestone][5].

This will allow you to optimize your [push opt-in rates][6] by prompting users at more appropriate times and will lead to a better user experience in how and when your app asks for push permission.
