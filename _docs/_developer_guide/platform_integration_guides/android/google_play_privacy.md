# Google Play privacy questionnaire

As of April 2022, Android developers must complete Google Play's [Data safety form][4] to disclose privacy and security practices. This guide provides instructions on how to fill out this new form with information on how Braze handles your app data. 

As the app developer, you are in control of what data you send to Braze. Data received by Braze is processed according to your instructions. This is what Google classifies as a [service provider][3]. 

{% alert important %}
This article provides information related to the data the Braze SDK processes as related to the Google safety section questionnaire. This article is not providing legal advice, so we recommend consulting with your legal team before submitting any information to Google.
