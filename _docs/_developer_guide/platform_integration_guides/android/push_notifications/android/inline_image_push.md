# Android inline image push

![Android Inline Image Push example]({% image_buster /assets/img/android/push/inline_image_push_android_1.png %}){: style="float:right;max-width:30%;margin-left:15px;border: 0;"}

Showcase a larger image within your Android push notification using Inline Image push. With this design, users won't have to manually expand the push to enlarge the image. 

No additional integration or SDK changes are required to use this feature. Devices or SDKs which don't meet the minimum version requirements will instead show a standard big image push notification.

## Usage requirements

- This notification type requires the Braze Android SDK v10.0.0+ and Android M+ devices. 
- Unsupported devices or SDKs will fallback to the standard big image push notification.
- Unlike regular Android push notifications, Inline Image push images are in a 3:2 aspect ratio.

{% alert tip %}
**Note**: Devices running Android 12 will render differently due to changes in custom push notification styles.
{% endalert %}

This feature is available in the **Notification Type** menu when creating an Android Push message.
