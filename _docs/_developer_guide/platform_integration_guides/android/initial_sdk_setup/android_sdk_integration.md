# Android SDK integration

Installing the Braze SDK will provide you with basic analytics functionality and working in-app messages with which you can engage your users.

{% alert note %}
For optimal performance on Android 12, we recommend upgrading to [Braze Android SDK v13.1.2+](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1312) as soon as possible. For more information, see our [Android 12 upgrade guide](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/android_12/).
{% endalert %}

## Step 1: Integrate the Braze library

The Braze Android SDK can optionally be integrated without UI components. However, Content Cards, News Feed, and in-app messaging will be rendered inoperable unless you pass the custom data to a UI solely of your design. Additionally, push notifications will not work because our push handling code is in the UI library. It is important to note that these UI elements are open source and fully customizable. We strongly recommend the integration of these features. Refer to the [Content Cards]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/about/#advantages-of-using-content-cards), [News Feed]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/news_feed/news_feed_use_cases/), and [in-app message]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/about/) documentation for a list of benefits of using each channel or tool.

### Basic integration

To access Braze's messaging features, you must integrate the UI library. See the following Android Studio directions to integrate the UI library depending on your IDE:

#### Add our repository

In your top-level project `build.gradle`, add the following as repositories under **allprojects > repositories**. For example:

```gradle
allprojects {
  repositories {
    google()
    maven { url "https://appboy.github.io/appboy-android-sdk/sdk" }
  }
}
```

{% alert note %}
The Braze Android SDK uses AndroidX Jetpack dependencies as of SDK version 10.0.0.
{% endalert %}

Alternatively, you can directly find the artifact AAR files on our [maven repository][71].

#### Add Braze dependency

Add the `android-sdk-ui` dependency to your app's `build.gradle`:

```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation "com.appboy:android-sdk-ui:+"
}
```

The following example shows where to place the dependency line in your `build.gradle`. Note that the version used in the example uses an old version. Visit [Braze Android SDK releases][60] for the most up-to-date version of the Braze Android SDK.

![Android studio displaying the "build.gradle". In this screenshot, the dependency code is added to the bottom of the file.][32]

#### Perform gradle sync

Be sure to perform a Gradle Sync to build your project and incorporate the [dependency additions](#add-braze-dependency).

![Android studio displaying a banner and button at the top of the application that says, "Gradle files have changed since last project sync. A project sync may be necessary for the IDE to work properly. Sync Now."][38]

## Step 2: Configure the Braze SDK in braze.xml

{% alert note %}
As of December 2019, custom endpoints are no longer given out, if you have a pre-existing custom endpoint, you may continue to use it. For more details, refer to our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/basics/#endpoints">list of available endpoints</a>.
{% endalert %}

Now that the libraries have been integrated, you must create a `braze.xml` file in your project's `res/values` folder. If you are on a specific data cluster or have a pre-existing custom endpoint, you need to specify the endpoint in your `braze.xml` file as well. 

The contents of that file should resemble the following code snippet. Make sure to substitute `YOUR_APP_IDENTIFIER_API_KEY` with the identifier found in the **Manage Settings** page of the Braze dashboard. To find out your specific cluster or endpoint, ask your Customer Success Manager or open a [support ticket][support].

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
<string name="com_braze_api_key">YOUR_APP_IDENTIFIER_API_KEY</string>
<string translatable="false" name="com_braze_custom_endpoint">YOUR_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT_OR_CLUSTER</string>
</resources>
```

## Step 3: Add required permissions to AndroidManifest.xml
Now that you've added your API key, you need to add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```

>  With the release of Android M, Android switched from an install-time to a runtime permissions model. However, both of these permissions are normal permissions and are granted automatically if listed in the app manifest. For more information, visit Android's [permission documentation][46].

## Step 4: Tracking user sessions in Android

### Activity lifecycle callback integration

Calls to `openSession()`, `closeSession()`,[`ensureSubscribedToInAppMessageEvents()`][64], and `InAppMessageManager` registration are optionally handled automatically.

#### Register activity lifecycle callbacks

Add the following code to the `onCreate()` method of your `Application` class:

{% tabs %}
{% tab JAVA %}

```java
public class MyApplication extends Application {
  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks(new BrazeActivityLifecycleCallbackListener(sessionHandlingEnabled, inAppMessagingRegistrationEnabled));
  }
}
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab KOTLIN %}

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks(BrazeActivityLifecycleCallbackListener(sessionHandlingEnabled, inAppMessagingRegistrationEnabled))
  }
}
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The first argument instructs the listener to handle `openSession()` and `closeSession()` calls.
The second argument instructs the listener to handle `registerInAppMessageManager()` and `unregisterInAppMessageManager()` calls.

See our [KDoc][63] for more information. Note that any non-standard manual session integration is not fully supported.

## Step 5: Enable location tracking

If you would like to enable Braze location collection, update your `braze.xml` file to include `com_braze_enable_location_collection` and ensure its value is set to `true`:

```xml
<bool name="com_braze_enable_location_collection">true</bool>
```

{% alert important %}
Starting with Braze Android SDK version 3.6.0, Braze location collection is disabled by default.
{% endalert %}

## SDK integration complete

Braze will now be able to collect [specified data from your application]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/user_data_collection/) and your basic integration should be complete.

Visit the following articles in order to enable [custom event tracking]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/analytics/tracking_custom_events/), [push messaging]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/push_notifications/android/integration/standard_integration/), [Content Cards]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/content_cards/integration/) and the complete suite of Braze features.
