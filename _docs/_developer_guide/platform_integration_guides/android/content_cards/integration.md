# Content Cards integration

> This reference article covers the Content Card integration and the different data models and card-specific properties available for your Android or FireOS application.

{% alert note %}
When you're ready to get started with implementation and customization, see the [Content Card Customization Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/customization_guides/content_cards).
{% endalert %}

In Android, the Content Cards feed is implemented as a [fragment](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html) available in the Braze Android UI project. View [Google's Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/fragments#Adding "Android Documentation: Fragments") for information on adding a fragment to an activity.

The [`ContentCardsFragment`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-android-sdk/kdoc/braze-android-sdk/com.braze.ui.contentcards/-content-cards-fragment/index.html) class will automatically refresh and display the contents of the Content Cards and log usage analytics. The cards that can appear in a user's `ContentCards` are created on the Braze dashboard.

## Content Card data model {#card-types-for-android}

The Content Cards data model is available in the Android SDK. For a full reference of the Content Card data model, see the [SDK reference documentation](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-android-sdk/kdoc/braze-android-sdk/com.braze.models.cards/index.html).

Braze has four unique Content Cards card types that share a base model: [image only](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-android-sdk/kdoc/braze-android-sdk/com.braze.models.cards/-image-only-card/index.html), [captioned image](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-android-sdk/kdoc/braze-android-sdk/com.braze.models.cards/-captioned-image-card/index.html), [classic (text announcement)](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-android-sdk/kdoc/braze-android-sdk/com.braze.models.cards/-text-announcement-card/index.html), and [classic (short news)](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-android-sdk/kdoc/braze-android-sdk/com.braze.models.cards/-short-news-card/index.html). Each type inherits common properties from a base model and has the following additional properties.

See [Logging analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/customization_guides/content_cards/logging_analytics) for information on subscribing to card data.

### Base Content Card model properties {#base-card-for-android}

The [base card](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-android-sdk/kdoc/braze-android-sdk/com.braze.models.cards/-card/index.html) model provides foundational behavior for all cards.

|`getId()` | Returns the card's ID set by Braze.|
|`getViewed()` | Returns a boolean reflects if the card is read or unread by the user.|
|`getExtras()` | Returns a map of key-value extras for this card.|
|`getCreated()`  | Returns the unix timestamp of the card's creation time from Braze.|
|`getIsPinned` | Returns a boolean that reflects whether the card is pinned.|

[Image only cards](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-android-sdk/kdoc/braze-android-sdk/com.braze.models.cards/-image-only-card/index.html) are clickable full-sized images.

|Property | Description |

|`getImageUrl()` | Returns the URL of the card's image.|
|`getUrl()` | Returns the URL that will be opened after the card is clicked. It can be a HTTP(s) URL or a protocol URL.|

### Captioned image card properties {#captioned-image-card-for-android}

[Captioned image cards](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-android-sdk/kdoc/braze-android-sdk/com.braze.models.cards/-captioned-image-card/index.html) are clickable, full-sized images with accompanying descriptive text.

|Property | Description |

### Classic card properties {#text-Announcement-card-for-android}

A classic card without an image included will result in a [text announcement card](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-android-sdk/kdoc/braze-android-sdk/com.braze.models.cards/-text-announcement-card/index.html). If an image is included, you will receive a [short news card](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-android-sdk/kdoc/braze-android-sdk/com.braze.models.cards/-short-news-card/index.html).

|Property | Description |

## Card methods

All [`Card`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-android-sdk/kdoc/braze-android-sdk/com.braze.models.cards/index.html) data model objects offer the following analytics methods for logging user events to Braze servers.

|Method | Description |

|`logImpression()` | Manually log an impression to Braze for a particular card. |
|`logClick()` | Manually log a click to Braze for a particular card. |
