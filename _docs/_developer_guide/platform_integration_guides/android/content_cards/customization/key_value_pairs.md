# Key-value pairs

`Card` objects may optionally carry key-value pairs as `extras`. These can be used to send data along with a `Card` for further handling by the application.

See our [KDoc][36] for more information.

{% alert note %}
Content Cards have a maximum size limit of 2 KB for content you enter in the Braze dashboard. This includes message text, image URLs, links, and key-value pairs. Exceeding that amount will prevent the card from sending.
{% endalert %}
