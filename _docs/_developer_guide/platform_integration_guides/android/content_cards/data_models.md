# Content cards integration

In Android, the Content Cards feed is implemented as a [Fragment][2] that are available in the Braze Android UI project. View [Google's documentation on Fragments][3] for information on how to add a Fragment to an Activity.

The [`ContentCardsFragment`][4] class will automatically refresh and display the contents of the Content Cards and log usage analytics. The cards that can appear in a user's ContentCards are created on the Braze dashboard.

## Content cards data model
The Content Cards data model is available in the Android SDK.

## Card types {#card-types-for-android}
Braze has 3 unique Content Cards card types that share a base model. Each card type also has additional card-specific properties which are listed below.

### Base card {#base-card-for-android}

The [Base Card][29] model provides foundational behavior for all cards.

[Banner Image Cards][30] are clickable full-sized images. In addition to the base card properties:

### Captioned image card {#captioned-image-card-for-android}

### Classic card {#text-announcement-card-for-android}
