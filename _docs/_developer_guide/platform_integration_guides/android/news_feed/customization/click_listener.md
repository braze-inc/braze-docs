# Handling clicks manually

You can handle News Feed clicks manually by setting a custom News Feed click listener. This enables use cases such as selectively using the native web browser to open web links.

## Step 1: Implement a News Feed click listener

Create a class that implements [`IFeedClickActionListener`][37]. Implement the `onFeedCardClicked()` method, which will be called when the user clicks a News Feed card.

## Step 2: Instruct Braze to use your News Feed click listener

Once your `IFeedClickActionListener` is created, call `AppboyFeedManager.getInstance().setFeedCardClickActionListener()` to instruct `AppboyFeedManager` to use your custom `IFeedClickActionListener`.
