# Handling clicks manually

{% alert note %}
News Feed is being deprecated. Braze recommends that customers who use our News Feed tool move over to our Content Cards messaging channelâ€”it's more flexible, customizable, and reliable. Check out the [migration guide]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/migrating_from_news_feed/) for more.
{% endalert %}

You can handle News Feed clicks manually by setting a custom News Feed click listener. This enables use cases such as selectively using the native web browser to open web links.

## Step 1: Implement a News Feed click listener

Create a class that implements [`IFeedClickActionListener`][37]. Implement the `onFeedCardClicked()` method, which will be called when the user clicks a News Feed card.

## Step 2: Instruct Braze to use your News Feed click listener

Once your `IFeedClickActionListener` is created, call `BrazeFeedManager.getInstance().setFeedCardClickActionListener()` to instruct `BrazeFeedManager` to use your custom `IFeedClickActionListener`.
