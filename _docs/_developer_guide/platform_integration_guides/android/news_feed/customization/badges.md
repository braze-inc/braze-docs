# Badges

{% alert note %}
News Feed is being deprecated. Braze recommends that customers who use our News Feed tool move over to our Content Cards messaging channelâ€”it's more flexible, customizable, and reliable. Check out the [migration guide]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/migrating_from_news_feed/) for more.
{% endalert %}

## Requesting unread News Feed card counts

You can request the number of unread cards at any time by calling:

```java
getUnreadCardCount()
```

Refer to our [KDoc][17] for more information.
