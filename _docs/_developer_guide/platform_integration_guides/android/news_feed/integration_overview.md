# News feed integration overview

In Android, the News Feed is implemented as a [Fragment][2] that are available in the Braze Android UI project. View [Google's documentation on Fragments][3] for information on how to add a Fragment to an Activity.

>  The Android UI Fragments do not automatically track session analytics. To ensure that sessions are tracked correctly, you should call `IAppboy.openSession()` when your app is opened (learn more about [tracking user sessions][4]).

The `AppboyFeedFragment` class will automatically refresh and display the contents of the News Feed and log usage analytics. The cards that can appear in a user's News Feed are set on the Braze dashboard.

Linking to the News Feed from an in-app message must be enabled by registering the `AppboyFeedActivity` within your `AndroidManifest.xml`.
