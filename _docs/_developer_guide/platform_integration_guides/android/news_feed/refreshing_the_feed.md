# Refreshing the feed

{% alert note %}
News Feed is being deprecated. Braze recommends that customers who use our News Feed tool move over to our Content Cards messaging channelâ€”it's more flexible, customizable, and reliable. Check out the [migration guide]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/migrating_from_news_feed/) for more.
{% endalert %}

You can queue a manual refresh of the Braze News Feed at any time by calling:

```java
Braze.requestFeedRefresh()
```

Refer to our [KDoc][16] for more information.
