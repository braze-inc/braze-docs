# Tracking custom events for iOS

You can record custom events in Braze to learn more about your app's usage patterns and to segment your users by their actions on the dashboard.

Before implementation, be sure to review examples of the segmentation options afforded by custom events, custom attributes, and purchase events in our [best practices][0], as well as our notes on [event naming conventions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/event_naming_conventions/).

## Adding a custom event

{% tabs %}
{% tab swift %}

```swift
AppDelegate.braze?.logCustomEvent(name: "YOUR_EVENT_NAME")
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab OBJECTIVE-C %}

```objc
[AppDelegate.braze logCustomEvent:@"YOUR_EVENT_NAME"];
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Adding properties

You can add metadata about custom events by passing a `Dictionary` populated with `Int`, `Double`, `String`, `Bool`, or `Date` values.

{% tabs %}
{% tab swift %}

```swift
AppDelegate.braze?.logCustomEvent(
  name: "YOUR-EVENT-NAME",
  properties: [
    "you": "can",
    "pass": false,
    "orNumbers": 42,
    "orDates": Date(),
    "or": ["any", "array", "here"],
    "andEven": [
      "deeply": ["nested", "json"]
    ]
  ]
)
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab OBJECTIVE-C %}

```objc
[AppDelegate.braze logCustomEvent:@"YOUR-EVENT-NAME"
                       properties:@{
  @"you": @"can",
  @"pass": @(NO),
  @"orNumbers": @42,
  @"orDates": [NSDate date],
  @"or": @[@"any", @"array", @"here"],
  @"andEven": @{
    @"deeply": @[@"nested", @"json"]
  }
}];
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
