## Changes in iOS 18

### Live Activities on Apple Watch

[Live Activities](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/live_activities/live_activities) will be supported on watchOS 11. No additional setup is required, however, Apple offers the option to customize the watch interface.

### Apple Vision Pro

The Vision Pro is now available in China, Japan, Singapore, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the UK. Check out our blog to see how [Braze supports visionOS](https://www.braze.com/resources/articles/building-braze-a-new-era-of-customer-engagement-braze-announces-visionos-support).

### iPhone notifications on macOS

Apple's new [iPhone mirroring](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/macos-sequoia-takes-productivity-and-intelligence-on-mac-to-new-heights/) feature allows users to receive iPhone notifications on their macOS devices. Keep in mind, some media types, such as Push Story images and GIFs, are not supported, since they can't be rendered as a macOS notification.
