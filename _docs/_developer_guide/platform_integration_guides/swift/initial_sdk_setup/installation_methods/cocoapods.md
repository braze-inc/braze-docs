# CocoaPods Integration

## Step 1: Install CocoaPods

Installing the iOS SDK via [CocoaPods][apple_initial_setup_1] automates the majority of the installation process for you. To install CocoaPods, refer to the CocoaPods [Getting Started guide][cocoapods_getting_started].

Run the following command to get started:

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

If you have issues regarding CocoaPods, refer to the CocoaPods [troubleshooting guide][apple_initial_setup_25].

## Step 2: Constructing the Podfile

Now that you've installed the CocoaPods Ruby Gem, you will need to create a file in your Xcode project directory named `Podfile`.

Add the following line to your Podfile:

```
target 'YourAppTarget' do
  pod 'BrazeKit'
end
```

`BrazeKit` contains the main SDK library, providing support for analytics and push notifications.

We suggest you version Braze so pod updates automatically grab anything smaller than a minor version update. This looks like `pod 'BrazeKit' ~> Major.Minor.Build`. If you want to automatically integrate the latest Braze SDK version, even with major changes, you can use `pod 'BrazeKit'` in your Podfile.

#### Additional Libraries

The Braze Swift SDK separates features into standalone libraries to provide developers with more control over which features to import into their projects. In addition to `BrazeKit`, you may add the following libraries to your Podfile:

| Library | Details |
| ------- | ------- |
| `pod 'BrazeLocation'` | Location library providing support for location analytics and geofence monitoring. |
| `pod 'BrazeUI'` | Braze-provided user interface library for In-App Messages and Content Cards. |
| `pod 'BrazeNotificationService'` | Notification service extension library providing support for rich push notifications. |
| `pod 'BrazePushStory'` | Notification content extension library providing support for Push Stories. |

## Step 3: Installing the Braze SDK

To install the Braze SDK CocoaPod, navigate to the directory of your Xcode app project within your terminal and run the following command:
```
pod install
```

At this point, you should be able to open the new Xcode project workspace created by CocoaPods. Make sure to use this Xcode workspace instead of your Xcode project.

## Updating the Braze SDK via CocoaPods

To update a CocoaPod, simply run the following command within your project directory:

```
pod update
```
