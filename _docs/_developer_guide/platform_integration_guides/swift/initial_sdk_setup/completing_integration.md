# Completing the Swift SDK integration

Before following these steps, make sure you have integrated the Swift SDK for iOS using either [Swift Package Manager]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/initial_sdk_setup/installation_methods/swift_package_manager/) or [CocoaPods]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/initial_sdk_setup/installation_methods/cocoapods/).

## Update your app delegate

{% tabs %}
{% tab swift %}

Add the following line of code to your `AppDelegate.swift` file to import the features included in the Braze Swift SDK:

```swift
import BrazeKit
```


Next, add a static property to your `AppDelegate` class to keep a strong reference to the Braze instance throughout your application's lifetime:

```swift
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
  static var braze: Braze? = nil
}
```

Finally, in `AppDelegate.swift`, add the following snippet to your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method:

```swift
let configuration = Braze.Configuration(
    apiKey: "YOUR-APP-IDENTIFIER-API-KEY",
    endpoint: "YOUR-BRAZE-ENDPOINT"
)
let braze = Braze(configuration: configuration)
AppDelegate.braze = braze
```

Update `YOUR-APP-IDENTIFIER-API-KEY` and `YOUR-BRAZE-ENDPOINT` with the correct value from your **Manage Settings** page. Check out our [API documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/api/api_key/#the-app-identifier-api-key) for more information on where to find your app identifier API key.

{% endtab %}
{% tab OBJECTIVE-C %}

Add the following line of code to your `AppDelegate.m` file:

```objc
@import BrazeKit;
```

Next, add a static variable to your `AppDelegate.m` file to keep a reference to the Braze instance throughout your application's lifetime:

```objc
static Braze *_braze;

@implementation AppDelegate
+ (Braze *)braze {
  return _braze;
}

+ (void)setBraze:(Braze *)braze {
  _braze = braze;
}
@end
```

Finally, within your `AppDelegate.m` file, add the following snippet within your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method:

```objc
BRZConfiguration *configuration = [[BRZConfiguration alloc] initWithApiKey:"YOUR-APP-IDENTIFIER-API-KEY"
                                                                  endpoint:"YOUR-BRAZE-ENDPOINT"];
Braze *braze = [[Braze alloc] initWithConfiguration:configuration];
AppDelegate.braze = braze;
```

Update `YOUR-APP-IDENTIFIER-API-KEY` and `YOUR-BRAZE-ENDPOINT` with the correct value from your **Manage Settings** page. Check out our [API documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/api/api_key/#the-app-identifier-api-key) for more information on where to find your app identifier API key.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}


## SDK integration complete

At this point, your basic integration should be complete. Braze should now be collecting data from your application. Follow the other articles in this integration guide to implement and customize the full range of Braze features and messaging channels.
