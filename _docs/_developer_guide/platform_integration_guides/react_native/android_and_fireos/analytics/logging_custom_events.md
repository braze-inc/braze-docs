## Tracking Custom Events

See [the Android integration instructions][1] for in depth discussion of event tracking best practices and interfaces. You should also check out our notes on [event naming conventions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/event_naming_conventions/).

```javascript
var properties = {};
properties["KeyOne"] = "Val1";
ReactAppboy.logCustomEvent("reactNativeCustomEventWithProperties", properties);
```
