# Push notifications

Integrating push notifications in React Native requires setting up each native platform separately. Follow the respective guides below to finish the installation.

## Step 1: complete native setup

- Android: Follow [the Android integration instructions][1].
- iOS: Follow [the iOS integration instructions][2].

## Step 2: test displaying push notifications

At this point, you should be able to send notifications to the devices. Follow the steps below to test your push integration.

{% alert important %}
You can't test push notification related app behavior on an iOS simulator because simulators don't support the device tokens required to send and receive a push notification.
{% endalert %}

1. Set an active user in the React application by calling `ReactAppboy.changeUserId('your-user-id')` method.
2. Head to **Campaigns** and create a new **Push Notification** campaign. Choose the platforms that you'd like to test.
3. Compose your test notification and head over to the **Test** tab. Add the same `user-id` as the test user and click **Send Test**. You should receive the notification on your device shortly.
