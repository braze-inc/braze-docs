# Sample app

> In the React Native SDK GitHub repository, you can find a sample application that implements many of the SDK methods.

You can use the app as a reference to building your own React Native integration.

You can find the application [here](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/tree/master/BrazeProject).

For sample usage of the Braze Expo plugin, refer to the sample application [here](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-expo-plugin/tree/main/example).
