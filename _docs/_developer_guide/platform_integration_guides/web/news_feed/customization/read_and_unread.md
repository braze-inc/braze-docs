# Read and unread indicators

{% alert note %}
News Feed is being deprecated. Braze recommends that customers who use our News Feed tool move over to our Content Cards messaging channelâ€”it's more flexible, customizable, and reliable. Check out the [migration guide]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/migrating_from_news_feed/) for more.
{% endalert %}

Braze provides an unread and read indicator on News Feed cards as shown in the following image:

![A News Feed card showing an image of a watch along with some text. In the upper corner of the text is a blue or grey triangle that indicates if a card has been read or not. A blue triangle signifies that a card has been read.][25]

## Disabling the indicators

In order to disable this functionality add the following style to your CSS:

``` css
.ab-read-dot { display: none; }
.ab-read-indicator { display: none; }
```
