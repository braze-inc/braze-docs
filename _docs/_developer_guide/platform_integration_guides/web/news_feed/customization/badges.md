{% alert note %}
News Feed is being deprecated. Braze recommends that customers who use our News Feed tool move over to our Content Cards messaging channelâ€”it's more flexible, customizable, and reliable. Check out the [migration guide]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/migrating_from_news_feed/) for more.
{% endalert %}

## Requesting unread News Feed card counts

You can request the number of unread cards at any time by calling:

``` javascript
braze.getCachedFeed().getUnreadCardCount();
```

This is often used to power badges signifying how many unread News Feed cards there are. See the [JSDocs](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/classes/braze.feed.html) for more information. Note that Braze will not refresh News Feed cards on new page loads (and so this function will return 0) until you show the feed or call `braze.requestFeedRefresh();`
