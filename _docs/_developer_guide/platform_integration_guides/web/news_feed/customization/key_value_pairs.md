`Card` objects may optionally carry key-value pairs as `extras`. These can be used to send data down along with a card for further handling by the application. Call `card.extras` to access these values.

See the JSDocs for more information on [ClassicCard](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/classes/braze.classiccard.html), [ImageOnly](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/classes/braze.imageonly.html), and [CaptionedImage](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/classes/braze.captionedimage.html).
