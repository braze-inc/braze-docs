# Key-value pairs

{% alert note %}
News Feed is being deprecated. Braze recommends that customers who use our News Feed tool move over to our Content Cards messaging channelâ€”it's more flexible, customizable, and reliable. Check out the [migration guide]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/migrating_from_news_feed/) for more.
{% endalert %}

`Card` objects may optionally carry key-value pairs as `extras`. These can be used to send data down along with a card for further handling by the application. Call `card.extras` to access these values.

See the JSDocs for more information on [ClassicCard][3], [Banner][4], and [CaptionedImage][5].
