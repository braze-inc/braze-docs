# Defining a News Feed Category

Instances of the Braze News Feed can be configured to only receive cards from a certain “category”. This allows for the effective integration of multiple News Feed streams within a single application.

News Feed categories can be defined by providing the third `allowedCategories` parameter to `toggleFeed`:

``` javascript
braze.toggleFeed(undefined, undefined, [braze.Card.Category.NEWS]);
```

You can also populate a feed with a combination of categories like in the following example:

``` javascript
braze.toggleFeed(undefined, undefined, [braze.Card.Category.ANNOUNCEMENTS, braze.Card.Category.NEWS]);
```
