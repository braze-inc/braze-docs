# Create a custom UI

## Refreshing the feed

To refresh and sync a user's feed with Braze servers, use the [`requestContentCardsRefresh`](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/modules/braze.html#requestcontentcardsrefresh) method:

```javascript
import * as braze from "@braze/web-sdk";

function refresh(){
  braze.requestContentCardsRefresh();    
}
```
## Listening for card updates

A callback function can be registered to subscribe for updates when cards are refreshed. 

{% alert important %}
Content Cards will only refresh on session start if `subscribeToContentCardsUpdates()` is called before `openSession()`. You can always manually refresh Content Cards using `requestContentCardsRefresh()`.
{% endalert %}

```javascript
import * as braze from "@braze/web-sdk";

braze.subscribeToContentCardsUpdates(function(updates){
  const cards = updates.cards;
  // do something with the latest instance of `cards`
});

braze.openSession();
```

## Logging events

Log impression events when cards are viewed by users:

```javascript
import * as braze from "@braze/web-sdk";

braze.logCardImpressions([card1, card2, card3], true);
```

Log card click events when users interact with a card:

```javascript
import * as braze from "@braze/web-sdk";

braze.logCardClick(card, true);
```
