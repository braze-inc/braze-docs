# Content Card Integration

The Braze Web SDK includes a Content Cards Feed UI to speed up your integration efforts. If you would prefer to build and your own UI instead, see our [Customization Guide](/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/content_cards/customization/).

## Standard Feed UI

To use the included Content Cards UI, you'll need to specify where on your website to show the feed. 

In this example, we have a `<div id="feed"></div>` in which we want to place the Content Cards feed. 

We'll use three buttons to hide, show, or toggle (hide or show based on its current state) the feed.

```html

<button id="toggle" type="button">Toggle Cards Feed</button>
<button id="hide" type="button">Hide Cards Feed</button>
<button id="show" type="button">Show Cards Feed</button>

<nav>
    <h1>Your Personalized Feed</h1>
    <div id="feed"></div>
</nav>

<script>
   // we'll assume we have window.appboy
   // you can also use our npm integration instead:
   // import braze from "@braze/web-sdk";
    
   const toggle = document.getElementById("toggle");
   const hide = document.getElementById("hide");
   const show = document.getElementById("show");
   const feed = document.getElementById("feed");
    
   toggle.onclick = function(){
      appboy.display.toggleContentCards(feed);    
   }
    
   hide.onclick = function(){
      appboy.display.hideContentCards();
   }
    
   show.onclick = function(){
      appboy.display.showContentCards(feed);    
   }
</script>
```

When using the `toggleContentCards(parentNode, filterFunction)` and `showContentCards(parentNode, filterFunction)` methods, if no arguments are provided, all Content Cards will be shown in a fixed-position sidebar on the right-hand side of the page. Otherwise, the feed will be placed in the specified `parentNode` option.

|Parameters | Description |
|---|---|
|`parentNode` | The HTML node to render the Content Cards into. If the parent node already has a Braze Content Cards view as a direct descendant, the existing Content Cards will be replaced. For example, you should pass in `document.querySelector(".my-container")`.|
|`filterFunction` | A filter/sort function for cards displayed in this view. Invoked with the array of ab.Card objects, sorted by {pinned, date}. Expected to return an array of sorted ab.Card objects to render for this user. If omitted, all cards will be displayed. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

[See the JS docs](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/module-display.html#.toggleContentCards) for more information on toggling Content Cards.

### Requesting Unviewed Content Card Count

You can request the number of unread cards at any time by calling:

```javascript
appboy.getCachedContentCards().getUnviewedCardCount();
```

This is often used to power badges signifying how many unread Content Cards there are. See the [JSDocs](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/ab.ContentCards.html#toc4) for more information.

{% comment %}
Braze will not refresh Content Cards on new page loads (and so this function will return 0) until you show the feed or call `appboy.requestContentCardsRefresh();`.
{% endcomment %}

### Control Group 

If you use Braze's default Content Cards feed, impressions and clicks will be automatically tracked.

If you use a custom integration for Content Cards, your integration needs to log impressions when a Control Card _would have been seen_.

Here is an example of how to determine if a Content Card is a "Control" card:

```javascript
function isControlCard(card) {
    return card instanceof appboy.ControlCard;
}
```

### Key-Value Pairs

`ab.Card` objects may optionally carry key-value pairs as `extras`. These can be used to send data down along with a card for further handling by the application. Call [`card.extras`](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/ab.Card.html) to access these values.
