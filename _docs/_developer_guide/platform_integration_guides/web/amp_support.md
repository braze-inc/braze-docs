# AMP Support

**This section is NOT a necessary integration step unless you're trying to integrate Braze on an AMP page.**

Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) is a Google-backed project designed to improve page load time on mobile devices by enforcing certain standards, including restricting the usage of JavaScript. 

As a result, the Braze SDK cannot be loaded onto an AMP page. However, the AMP project does provide a component that supports web push. The following instructions detail how to setup that component and reference the following documentation on the `amp-web-push` component: https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-web-push

## Step 1: Include AMP Web Push Script

Add the following async script tag to your head:

```
<script async custom-element="amp-web-push" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-web-push-0.1.js"></script>
```

## Step 2: Add Subscription / Unsubscription Widget

You'll need to add a widget that allows users to subscribe and unsubscribe from push. This should live inside the body of your HTML and can be styled however you see fit. 

```
<!-- A subscription widget -->
<amp-web-push-widget visibility="unsubscribed" layout="fixed" width="250" height="80">
  <button on="tap:amp-web-push.subscribe">Subscribe to Notifications</button>
</amp-web-push-widget>

<!-- An unsubscription widget -->
<amp-web-push-widget visibility="subscribed" layout="fixed" width="250" height="80">
  <button on="tap:amp-web-push.unsubscribe">Unsubscribe from Notifications</button>
</amp-web-push-widget>
```

## Step 3: Download Helper IFrame & Permission Dialog

The AMP Web Push component works by creating a popup that handles the push subscription. As a result, you'll need to include a couple of helper files into your project. Download the [helper-iframe.html](https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-web-push-helper-frame.html) file and [permission-dialog.html](https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-web-push-permission-dialog.html) file and store them on your site. 

## Step 4: Create a Service Worker File

Create a `service-worker.js` file with the content below, and place it in the root directory of your website:

<script src="https://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-web-sdk/blob/master/sample-build/service-worker.js?footer=minimal"></script>

## Step 5: Configure AMP Web Push HTML Element

You'll now need to add the amp-web-push html element to your page. Drop the following HTML code into the body of your document:

```
<amp-web-push
layout="nodisplay"
id="amp-web-push"
helper-iframe-url="FILE_PATH_TO_YOUR_HELPER_IFRAME"
permission-dialog-url="FILE_PATH_TO_YOUR_PERMISSION_DIALOG"
service-worker-url="FILE_PATH_TO_YOUR_SERVICE_WORKER?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY&baseUrl=YOUR_BASE_URL"
>
```

In particular, the service-worker-URL requires appending your apiKey and baseUrl (https://dev.appboy.com/api/v3) as query parameters, as shown above. 

You should now be configured for push subscription and unsubscription on your AMP page.
