# Google Tag Manager

This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to add the Braze Web SDK to your website using the Google Tag Manager.

[Google Tag Manager][2] lets you remotely add, remove, and edit tags on your website without requiring a production code release or engineering resources.

## Braze tag templates

There are two Google Tag Manager templates built by Braze, the [Initialization Tag](#initialization-tag) and the [Actions Tag](#actions-tag).

Both tags can be added to your workspace from [Google's community gallery][15] or by searching for Braze when adding a new tag from the Community Templates.

### Initialization Tag template {#initialization-tag}

Use the Initialization Tag to add the Braze Web SDK to your website.

#### Step 1: Select the Initialization Tag

Search for Braze in the community template gallery, and select the **Braze Initialization Tag**.

#### Step 2. Configure settings

Enter your Braze API app identifier key and SDK endpoint, which can be found in your dashboard's **Manage Settings** page.

#### Step 3. Choose initialization options

Choose from the optional set of additional initialization options described in the [Initial setup][7] guide.

#### Step 4: Verify and QA

Once you've deployed this tag, there are two ways you can verify a proper integration:

1. Using Google Tag Manager's debug move, you should see the Braze Initialization Tag has been triggered on your configured pages or events.
2. You should see network requests made to Braze, and the global `window.braze` library should now be defined on your webpage.

### Actions Tag template {#actions-tag}

The Braze Actions Tag template lets you trigger custom events, track purchases, change user IDs, and stop or resume tracking for privacy requirements.

#### Changing user external ID {#external-id}

The **Change User** tag type calls the [`changeUser` method](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/modules/braze.html#changeuser). 

Use this tag whenever a user logs in or is otherwise identified with their unique `external_id` identifier.

Be sure to enter the current user's unique ID in the **External User ID** field, typically populated using a data layer variable sent by your website.

#### Log custom events {#custom-events}

The **Custom Event** tag type calls the [`logCustomEvent` method](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/modules/braze.html#logcustomevent).

Use this tag to send custom events to Braze, optionally including custom event properties.

Enter the **Event Name** by either using a variable or typing an event name.

Use the **Add Row** button to add event properties.

#### Track purchase {#purchases}

The **Purchase** tag type calls the [`logPurchase` method](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/modules/braze.html#logpurchase).

Use this tag to track purchases to Braze, optionally including Purchase properties.

The **Product ID** and **Price** fields are required.

Use the **Add Row** button to add Purchase properties.

![A dialog box showing the Braze Action Tag configuration settings. Settings included are "tag type", "external ID", "price", "currency code", "quanitity", and "purchase properties".][10]

#### Stop and resume tracking {#stop-tracking}

Sometimes, you might be required to disable or re-enable Braze tracking on your website, for example, after a user indicates they've opted out of web tracking for privacy reasons.

Use the **Disable Tracking** or **Resume Tracking** tag type to disable or re-enable web tracking, respectively.

#### Custom user attributes {#custom-attributes}

Custom user attributes are not available due to a limitation in Google Tag Manager's scripting language. To log custom attributes, create a Custom HTML tag with the following content:

```html
<script>
window.braze.getUser().setCustomUserAttribute("attribute name", "attribute value");
</script>
```

{% alert important %}
The GTM template does not support nested properties on events or purchases. You can use the preceding HTML to log any events or purchases that require nested properties.
{% endalert %}

#### Default user attributes {#standard-attributes}

Default user attributes, such as a user's first name, should be logged in the same manner as custom user attributes. Ensure the values you're passing in for default attributes match the expected format specified in the [User class][16] documentation.

For example, the gender attribute can accept any of the following as values: `"m" | "f" | "o" | "u" | "n" | "p"`. Therefore to set a user's gender as female, create a Custom HTML tag with the following content:

```html
<script>
window.braze.getUser().setGender("f")
</script>
```

## Troubleshooting steps {#troubleshooting}

### Enable tag debugging {#debugging}

Each Braze tag template has an optional **GTM Tag Debugging** checkbox which can be used to log debug messages to your webpage's Javascript console.

![][12]

### Enter debug mode

Another way to help debug your Google Tag Manager integration is using Google's [Preview mode][14] feature.

This will help identify what values are being sent from your webpage's data layer to each triggered Braze tag and will also explain which tags were or were not triggered.

![The Braze Initialization Tag summary page provides an overview of the tag, including information on which tags were triggered.][13]
