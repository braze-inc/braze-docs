# Troubleshooting

## "File could not be read" errors

Errors resembling the following may be safely ignored. Apple software uses a proprietary PNG extension called CgBI, which Unity does not recognize. These errors will not affect your iOS build or the proper display of the associated images in the Braze bundle.

```
Could not create texture from Assets/Plugins/iOS/AppboyKit/Appboy.bundle/...png: File could not be read
```
