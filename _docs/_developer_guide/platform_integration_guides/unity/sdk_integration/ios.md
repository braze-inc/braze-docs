# SDK iOS integration

> This reference article covers the iOS SDK integration for the Unity platform. Follow these guide to get Braze running in your Unity application. 

If you are transitioning from a manual integration, read the instructions on [Transitioning to an automated integration](#transitioning-from-manual-to-automated-integration-ios).

## Step 1: Choose your Braze Unity package

The Braze [`.unitypackage`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html) bundles native bindings for the Android and iOS platforms, along with a C# interface.

The Braze Unity package is available for download on the [Braze Unity releases page](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-unity-sdk/releases) with two integration options:

1. `Appboy.unitypackage` only
  - This package bundles the Braze Android and iOS SDKs without any additional dependencies. With this integration method, there will not be proper functionality of Braze in-app messaging, and Content Cards features on iOS. If you intend on utilizing full Braze functionality without custom code, use the option below instead.
  - To use this integration option, ensure that the box next to `Import SDWebImage dependency` is *unchecked* in the Unity UI under "Braze Configuration".
2. `Appboy.unitypackage` with `SDWebImage`
  - This integration option bundles the Braze Android and iOS SDKs and the [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage) dependency for the iOS SDK, which is required for the proper functionality of Braze in-app messaging, and Content Cards features on iOS. The `SDWebImage` framework is used for downloading and displaying images, including GIFs. If you intend on utilizing full Braze functionality, download and import this package.
  - To automatically import `SDWebImage`, be sure to *check* the box next to `Import SDWebImage dependency` in the Unity UI under "Braze Configuration".

**iOS**: To see if you require the [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage) dependency for your iOS project, visit the [iOS in-app message documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/in-app_messaging/overview/).<br>
**Android**: As of Unity 2.6.0, the bundled Braze Android SDK artifact requires [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) dependencies. If you were previously using a `jetified unitypackage`, then you can safely transition to the corresponding `unitypackage`.

## Step 2: Import the package

In the Unity Editor, import the package into your Unity project by navigating to **Assets > Import Package > Custom Package**. Next, click **Import**.

Alternatively, follow the [Unity asset package import](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html) instructions for a more detailed guide on importing custom Unity packages. 

{% alert note %}
If you only wish to import the iOS or Android plugin, deselect the `Plugins/Android` or `Plugins/iOS` subdirectory when importing the Braze `.unitypackage`.
{% endalert %}

## Step 3: Set your API key

Braze provides a native Unity solution for automating the Unity iOS integration. This solution modifies the built Xcode project using Unity's [`PostProcessBuildAttribute`](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Callbacks.PostProcessBuildAttribute.html) and subclasses the `UnityAppController` using the `IMPL_APP_CONTROLLER_SUBCLASS` macro.

1. In the Unity Editor, open the Braze Configuration Settings by navigating to **Braze > Braze Configuration**.
2. Check the **Automate Unity iOS Integration** box.
3. In the **Braze API Key** field, input your application's API key found in **Manage Settings**.

If your application is already using another `UnityAppController` subclass, you will need to merge your subclass implementation with `AppboyAppDelegate.mm`.

## Basic SDK integration complete

Braze should now be collecting data from your application, and your basic integration should be complete.
