# SDK Android Integration

Follow the below instructions to get Braze running in your Unity application. If you are transitioning from a manual integration, please read the instructions on [Transitioning From a Manual to an Automated Integration][5].

## Step 1: Choose your Braze Unity Package

The Braze [`.unitypackage`][41] bundles native bindings for the Android and iOS platforms, along with a C# interface.

There are several Braze Unity packages available for download at [Braze Unity Releases Page][42]:
 
* `Appboy.unitypackage`
    - This package bundles the Braze Android and iOS SDKs as well as the [SDWebImage][unity-1] dependency for the iOS SDK, which is required for proper functionality of Braze's In-App Messaging, and Content Cards features on iOS. The [SDWebImage][unity-1] framework is used for downloading and displaying images, including GIFs. If you intend on utilizing full Braze functionality, download and import this package.<br>
* `Appboy-nodeps.unitypackage`
    - This package is similar to `Appboy.unitypackage` except for the [SDWebImage][unity-1] framework not being present. This package is useful if you do not want the [SDWebImage][unity-1] framework present in your iOS app.
<br><br>

> iOS: To see if you require the [SDWebImage][unity-1] dependency for your iOS project, please visit the [iOS In-App Message Documentation][unity-4].<br><br>Android: As of Unity 2.6.0, the bundled Braze Android SDK artifact requires  [AndroidX][unity-3] dependencies. If you were previously using a `jetified unitypackage`, then you can safely transition to the corresponding `unitypackage` above.

## Step 2: Import the Package

1. In the Unity Editor, import the package into your Unity project by navigating to `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package`.
2. Click __Import__.

Alternatively, follow the Unity instructions for [Importing Asset packages][41] for a more detailed guide on importing custom Unity packages. 

{% alert note %}
If you only wish to import the iOS/Android plugin, deselect the `Plugins/Android`/`Plugins/iOS` subdirectory when importing the Braze `.unitypackage`.
{% endalert %}

## Step 3a: Updating your AndroidManifest.xml

Android Unity projects require an [`AndroidManifest.xml`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-manifest.html) to be present to run the application. Additionally, Braze requires several additions to your [`AndroidManifest.xml`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-manifest.html) in order to function.

#### Part 1: Configuring the AndroidManifest.xml

If your app does not have an `AndroidManifest.xml`, you can use the following as a template. Otherwise, if you already have an `AndroidManifest.xml`, ensure that any missing sections below are added to your existing `AndroidManifest.xml`.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
          package="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME">

  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

  <application android:icon="@drawable/app_icon" 
               android:label="@string/app_name">

    <!-- Calls the necessary Braze methods to ensure that analytics are collected and that push notifications are properly forwarded to the Unity application. -->
    <activity android:name="com.appboy.unity.AppboyUnityPlayerActivity" 
      android:label="@string/app_name" 
      android:configChanges="fontScale|keyboard|keyboardHidden|locale|mnc|mcc|navigation|orientation|screenLayout|screenSize|smallestScreenSize|uiMode|touchscreen" 
      android:screenOrientation="sensor">
      <meta-data android:name="android.app.lib_name" android:value="unity" />
      <meta-data android:name="unityplayer.ForwardNativeEventsToDalvik" android:value="true" />
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
      </intent-filter>
    </activity>

    <!-- A Braze specific FirebaseMessagingService used to handle push notifications. -->
    <service android:name="com.appboy.AppboyFirebaseMessagingService"
      android:exported="false">
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
      </intent-filter>
    </service>

    <!-- BroadcastReceiver used to forward certain Braze push notification events to Unity -->
    <receiver android:name="com.appboy.unity.AppboyUnityPushBroadcastReceiver" android:exported="false" >
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME.intent.APPBOY_PUSH_RECEIVED" />
        <action android:name="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME.intent.APPBOY_NOTIFICATION_OPENED" />
        <action android:name="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME.intent.APPBOY_PUSH_DELETED" />
      </intent-filter>
    </receiver>
  </application>
</manifest>
```

> Your `AndroidManifest.xml` should exist under `Assets/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest.xml`. Please see [the Unity AndroidManifest documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-manifest.html) for more information.

> All Activity classes registered in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file should be fully integrated with the Braze Android SDK. If you add your own Activity class, you must follow [Braze's Unity Activity integration instructions](#extending-braze-unity-player) to ensure that analytics are being collected.

{% alert note %}
Your final `AndroidManifest.xml` should only contain a single Activity with `"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"` present.
{% endalert %}

#### Part 2: Finding your Package Name 

- Click File -> Build Settings -> Player Settings -> Android Tab
![Unity Package Name]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/UnityPackageName.png %})

#### Part 3: Make Replacements in the AndroidManifest

In your `AndroidManifest.xml`, all instances of `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME` should be replaced with your `Package Name` from the previous step.

### Step 4: Add Gradle Dependencies {#unity-android-gradle-configuration}

The following dependencies are required:

```groovy
implementation "androidx.appcompat:appcompat:+"

// Both are required if using the default Content Cards Activity on Android
implementation "androidx.swiperefreshlayout:swiperefreshlayout:+"
implementation "androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:+"
```

Examples on how to add these dependencies using Unity tools are provided below.

#### Custom Gradle Template

[Custom Gradle Template](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-gradle-overview.html)

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation "androidx.appcompat:appcompat:+"
}
```

#### External Dependency Manager for Unity

[External Dependency Manager for Unity](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver)

```xml
<dependencies>
  <androidPackages>
    <androidPackage spec="androidx.appcompat:appcompat:+" />
  </androidPackages>
</dependencies>
```

### Step 5: Configure the SDK {#unity-static-configuration}

Braze provides a native Unity solution for automating the Unity Android integration. 

1. In the Unity Editor, open the Braze Configuration Settings by navigating to Braze > Braze Configuration.
2. Check the "Automate Unity Android Integration" box.
3. In the "Braze API Key" field, input your application's API key from the Braze Dashboard.

>  Your Braze API key can be found within the **Settings** page of the Braze dashboard. To find out your specific cluster or endpoint, please ask your Customer Success Manager or [open a support ticket]({{site.baseurl}}/support_contact/).

{% alert note %}
This automatic integration should not be used in conjunction with a manually created `braze.xml` file since the configuration values may conflict during project building. If you require the use of a manual `braze.xml`, please disable the automatic integration.
{% endalert %}

## Basic SDK Integration Complete

Braze should now be collecting data from your application and your basic integration should be complete.

- __Push__: See the [Android][53] or [iOS][50] push documentation for information on integrating push.
- __In-App Messages__: See the [In-App Message documentation][34] for information on integrating in-app messages.
- __Content Cards__: See the [Content Cards documentation][40] for information on integrating Content Cards.
- __News Feed__: See the [News Feed documentation][35] for information on integrating the News Feed.

## Additional Advanced Implementation Options

### Extending Braze's Unity Player (Android) {#extending-braze-unity-player}

The example `AndroidManifest.xml` file provided has one Activity class registered, [`AppboyUnityPlayerActivity`](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/e67e09f785adeff075a5d7710e79f41ed3676a6a/android-sdk-unity/src/main/java/com/appboy/unity/AppboyUnityPlayerActivity.java). This class is integrated with the Braze SDK and extends `UnityPlayerActivity` with session handling, in-app message registration, push notification analytics logging, and more. See [this documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AndroidUnityPlayerActivity.html) for more information on extending the `UnityPlayerActivity` class.

If you are creating your own custom `UnityPlayerActivity` in a library or plugin project, you will need to extend Braze's `AppboyUnityPlayerActivity` to integrate your custom functionality with Braze.

>  Before beginning work on extending `AppboyUnityPlayerActivity`, follow our instructions for integrating Braze into your Unity project.

1. Add the Braze Android SDK as a dependency to your library or plugin project as described in the [Braze Android SDK integration instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/initial_sdk_setup/android_sdk_integration/).
2. Integrate our Unity `.aar`, which contains Braze's Unity-specific functionality, to your Android library project you are building for Unity. The `appboy-unity.aar` is available from our [public repo](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-unity-sdk/tree/master/Assets/Plugins/Android). Once our Unity library is successfully integrated, modify your `UnityPlayerActivity` to extend `AppboyUnityPlayerActivity`.
3. Export your library or plugin project and drop it into `/<your-project>/Assets/Plugins/Android` as normal. Do not include any Braze source code in your library or plugin as they will already be present in `/<your-project>/Assets/Plugins/Android`.
4. Edit your `/<your-project>/Assets/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest.xml` to specify your `AppboyUnityPlayerActivity` subclass as the main activity.

You should now be able to package an `.apk` from the Unity IDE that is fully integrated with Braze and contains your custom `UnityPlayerActivity` functionality.
