# Refreshing the News Feed

{% alert note %}
News Feed is being deprecated. Braze recommends that customers who use our News Feed tool move over to our Content Cards messaging channelâ€”it's more flexible, customizable, and reliable. Check out the [migration guide]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/migrating_from_news_feed/) for more.
{% endalert %}

You can manually request Braze to refresh the user's News Feed in `Appboy.h` using `- (void) requestFeedRefresh;`. For example:

{% tabs %}
{% tab OBJECTIVE-C %}

```objc
[[Appboy sharedInstance] requestFeedRefresh];
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab swift %}

```swift
Appboy.sharedInstance()?.requestFeedRefresh()
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

For more information, see the `Appboy.h` [header file][15].
