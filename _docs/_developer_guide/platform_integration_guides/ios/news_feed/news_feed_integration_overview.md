# News feed integration overview

{% alert note %}
Braze recommends that customers who use our News Feed tool move over to our Content Cards messaging channel - it is more flexible, customizable, and reliable. It is also easier to find and use in the Braze product. Contact your Braze account manager for more information.
{% endalert %}

Integrating the view controller `ABKNewsFeedViewController` will display the Braze News Feed.

You have a great deal of flexibility in how you choose to display the view controllers. There are different versions of the view controllers to accommodate different navigation structures.

>  The News Feed that is called by the default behavior of an in-app message click will not respect any delegates that you set for the News Feed. If you want to respect that, you must [set the delegate on `ABKInAppMessageUIController`][1] and implement the `ABKInAppMessageUIDelegate` delegate method [`onInAppMessageClicked:`][2].

## News feed view controller integration options

The News Feed can be integrated with 2 view controller contexts, either in code or via a storyboard implementation.

### Navigation context -- abkfeedviewcontrollernavigationcontext

{% tabs %}
{% tab OBJECTIVE-C %}

```objc
ABKNewsFeedTableViewController *newsFeed = [[ABKNewsFeedTableViewController alloc] init];
[self.navigationController pushViewController:newsFeed animated:YES];
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab swift %}

```swift
let newsFeed = ABKNewsFeedTableViewController()
self.navigationController?.pushViewController(newsFeed, animated: true)
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% alert note %}
To customize the navigation bar's title, set the title property of the `ABKNewsFeedTableViewController` instance's `navigationItem`.
{% endalert %}

### Modal context -- abkfeedviewcontrollermodalcontext

- Used to present the view controller in a modal view, with a navigation bar on top and a Done button on the right side of the bar
- Set the modal's title via the embedded `ABKNewsFeedTableViewController` instance's `navigationItem`'s `title` property
- If a delegate __is NOT set__ the Done button will dismiss the modal view
- If a delegate __is set__ the Done button will call the delegate, and the delegate itself will be responsible for dismissing the view

{% tabs %}
{% tab OBJECTIVE-C %}

```objc
ABKNewsFeedViewController *newsFeed = [[ABKNewsFeedViewController alloc] init];
[self presentViewController:newsFeed animated:YES completion:nil];
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab swift %}

```swift
let newsFeed = ABKNewsFeedViewController()
self.present(newsFeed, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

>  The [News Feed sample app][3] contains examples of the view controllers.
