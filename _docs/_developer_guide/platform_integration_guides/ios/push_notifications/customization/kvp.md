# Extracting data from push notification key-value pairs

Braze allows you to send custom-defined string key-value pairs, known as extras, along with a push notification to your application. Extras can be defined via the dashboard or API and will be available as key-value pairs within the notification dictionary passed to your push delegate implementations.
