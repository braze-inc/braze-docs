# Initial SDK Setup

As of version [3.32.0][1], the Braze SDK supports macOS for apps using [Mac Catalyst][2] when integrating through Swift Package Manager. Currently, the SDK does not support Mac Catalyst when using Cocoapods or Carthage.

{% alert note %}
To build your app with Mac Catalyst, please reference <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/mac_catalyst">Apple's documentation here</a>.
{% endalert %}

Once your app supports Catalyst, follow [these instructions to use Swift Package Manager][3] to import the Braze SDK into your app.

## Supported Features

Braze supports push notifications and location features when running on Mac Catalyst. To integrate push in your Catalyst app, follow the [iOS SDK instructions here][4]. For enabling automatic location collection, follow the [setup instructions here][5].

Please note that Push Stories, Rich Push, and Geofences are not supported on MacOS.
