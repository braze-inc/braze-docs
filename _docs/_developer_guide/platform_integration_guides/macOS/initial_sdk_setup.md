# Initial SDK setup

As of version [3.32.0][1], the Braze SDK supports macOS for apps using [Mac Catalyst][2] when integrating through Swift Package Manager. Currently, the SDK does not support Mac Catalyst when using Cocoapods or Carthage.

{% alert note %}
To build your app with Mac Catalyst, reference <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/mac_catalyst">Apple's documentation</a>.
{% endalert %}

Once your app supports Catalyst, follow [these instructions to use Swift Package Manager][3] to import the Braze SDK into your app.

## Supported features

Braze supports [push notifications][4], [Content Cards][7], [in-app messages][5], and [automatic location collection][5] when running on Mac Catalyst.

Note that Push Stories, rich push, and geofences are not supported on macOS.
