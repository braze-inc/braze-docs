# News Feed

The News Feed is a fully customizable in-app content feed for your users. Our targeting and segmentation allows you to create a stream of content that is individually catered to the interests of each user. Depending on their position in the user life cycle and the nature of your app, this could be an on-boarding content server, an advertisement center, an achievement center, or a generic news center.
