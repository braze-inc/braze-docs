# Content Card integration

> This article covers how to set up Content Cards for your Flutter app.

The Braze SDK includes a default card feed to get you started with Content Cards. To show the card feed, you can use the `braze.launchContentCards()` method. The default card feed included with the Braze SDK will handle all analytics tracking, dismissals, and rendering for a user's Content Cards.

## Customization

You can use these additional methods to build a custom Content Cards Feed within your app by using the following methods available on the [plugin public interface](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-flutter-sdk/blob/master/lib/braze_plugin.dart):

| Method                                         | Description                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `braze.requestContentCardsRefresh()`     | Requests the latest Content Cards from the Braze SDK server.                                           |
| `braze.logContentCardClicked(contentCard)`    | Logs a click for the given Content Card object.                                                            |
| `braze.logContentCardImpression(contentCard)` | Logs an impression for the given Content Card object.                                                      |
| `braze.logContentCardDismissed(contentCard)`  | Logs a dismissal for the given Content Card object.                                                        |

## Receiving Content Card data

To receive Content Card data in your Flutter app, the `BrazePlugin` supports sending Content Card data by using [Dart Streams](https://dart.dev/tutorials/language/streams).

The `BrazeContentCard` [object](https://pub.dev/documentation/braze_plugin/latest/braze_plugin/BrazeContentCard-class.html) supports a subset of fields available in the native model objects, including `description`, `title`, `image`, `url`, `extras`, and more.

### Step 1: Listen for Content Card data in the Dart layer

To receive to the content card data in the Dart layer, use the code below to create a `StreamSubscription` and call `braze.subscribeToContentCards()`. Remember to `cancel()` the stream subscription when it is no longer needed.

```dart
// Create stream subscription
StreamSubscription contentCardsStreamSubscription;

contentCardsStreamSubscription = braze.subscribeToContentCards((List<BrazeContentCard> contentCards) {
  // Handle Content Cards
}

// Cancel stream subscription
contentCardsStreamSubscription.cancel();
```

For an example, see [main.dart](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-flutter-sdk/blob/master/example/lib/main.dart) in our sample app.

### Step 2: Forward Content Card data from the native layer

To receive the data in the Dart layer from step 1, add the following code to forward the Content Card data from the native layers.

{% tabs %}
{% tab Android %}

The Content Card data is automatically forwarded from the Android layer.

{% endtab %}
{% tab iOS %}

1. Implement `contentCards.subscribeToUpdates` to subscribe to content cards updates as described in the [subscribeToUpdates](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/contentcards-swift.class/subscribetoupdates(_:)) documentation.

2. Your `contentCards.subscribeToUpdates` callback implementation must call `BrazePlugin.processContentCards(contentCards)`.

For an example, see [AppDelegate.swift](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-flutter-sdk/blob/master/example/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift) in our sample app.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Replaying the callback for Content Cards

To store any Content Cards triggered before the callback is available and replay them after it is set, add the following entry to the `customConfigs` map when initializing the `BrazePlugin`:
```dart
BrazePlugin braze = new BrazePlugin(customConfigs: {replayCallbacksConfigKey: true});
```

## Test displaying sample Content Card

Follow these steps to test a sample Content Card.

1. Set an active user in the React application by calling `braze.changeUserId('your-user-id')` method.
2. Head to **Campaigns** and follow [this guide]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/create) to create a new Content Card campaign.
3. Compose your test Content Card campaign and head over to the **Test** tab. Add the same `user-id` as the test user and click **Send Test**.
4. Tap the push notification and that should launch a Content Card on your device. You may need to refresh your feed for it to display.

For more details on each platform, follow the [Android integration]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/content_cards/data_models/) or [iOS integration](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/tutorials/braze/c2-contentcardsui) guides.
