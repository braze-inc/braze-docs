# In-app messages and Content Cards on tvOS

{% alert note %}
In-app message and Content Card support on tvOS is only available using our Swift SDK.
{% endalert %}

On tvOS, you can execute messaging on both in-app message and Content Card channels by integrating the [Braze Swift SDK][swift-sdk]. After adding the Braze SDK to your Xcode project for your tvOS app, note the following details during your configuration:

**1\.** Create a new iOS app under **Manage Settings** in the Braze dashboard for your tvOS app.<br>![][1]{: style="width:70%"}<br>
{% alert warning %}
Do not choose tvOS from the checkbox list; doing so will prohibit you from leveraging Content Cards or in-app messages.
{% endalert %}

**2\.** Use the API key listed in **Manage Settings** when referencing the API key during your SDK configuration in your Xcode project.<br>![][2]{: style="width:70%"}

## Customization

Braze does not provide default UIs for Content Cards or In-App Messages on tvOS.

Reference our [In-app message custom UI](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/braze/in-app-message-customization) and [Content Cards custom UI](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/braze/content-cards-customization) articles to further customize these channels on tvOS when integrating. We also offer [example projects](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/tree/main/Examples) to reference as well to aid in the integration.
