# Other SDK customizations

## Braze log level

The default log level for the Braze iOS SDK is minimal, or `8` in the following chart. This level suppresses most logging so that no sensitive information is logged in a production-released application.

See the following list of available log levels:

### Log levels

| Level    | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 0        | Verbose. All log information will be logged to the iOS console.  |
| 1        | Debug. Debug and higher log information will be logged to the iOS console.  |
| 2        | Warning. Warning and higher log information will be logged to the iOS console.  |
| 4        | Error. Error and higher log information will be logged to the iOS console.  |
| 8        | Minimal. Minimal information will be logged to the iOS console. The SDK's default setting. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

### Verbose logging

You can configure log level to any available value. However, setting log level to verbose, or `0`, can be very useful for debugging issues with your integration. This level is only intended for development environments and should not be set in a released application. Verbose logging won't send any extra or new user information to Braze.

### Setting log level

Log level can be assigned either at compile time or at runtime:

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Compile Time %}

Add a dictionary named `Braze` to your `Info.plist` file. Inside the `Braze` dictionary, add the `LogLevel` string subentry and set the value to `0`. 

{% alert note %}
Prior to Braze iOS SDK v4.0.2, the dictionary key `Appboy` must be used in place of `Braze`.
{% endalert %} 

Example `Info.plist` contents:

```
<key>Braze</key>
<dict>
  <key>LogLevel</key>
  <string>0</string>
</dict>
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab Runtime %}

Add the `ABKLogLevelKey` inside the `appboyOptions` parameter passed to `startWithApiKey:inApplication:withLaunchOptions:withAppboyOptions:`. Set its value to the integer `0`.

{% subtabs %}
{% subtab OBJECTIVE-C %}

```objc
NSMutableDictionary *appboyOptions = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
appboyOptions[ABKLogLevelKey] = @(0);
[Appboy startWithApiKey:@"YOUR-API-KEY"
          inApplication:application
      withLaunchOptions:launchOptions
      withAppboyOptions:appboyOptions];
```

{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab swift %}

```swift
let appboyOptions: [AnyHashable: Any] = [
  ABKLogLevelKey : 0
]
Appboy.start(withApiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY", in:application, withLaunchOptions:launchOptions, withAppboyOptions:appboyOptions)
```

{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}

{% alert note %}
Log level can only be set at runtime with Braze iOS SDK v4.4.0 or newer. If using an earlier version of the SDK, set log level at compile time instead.
{% endalert %} 

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Optional IDFV collection - Swift

In previous versions of the Braze iOS Swift SDK, the IDFV (Identifier for Vendor) field was automatically collected as the user's device ID. 

Beginning in Swift SDK v5.7.0, the IDFV field can optionally be disabled, and instead, Braze will set a random UUID as the device ID. For more information, refer to [Collecting IDFV]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/analytics/swift_idfv/).

## Optional IDFA collection

IDFA Collection is optional within the Braze SDK and disabled by default. IDFA Collection is only required within Braze if you intend to use our [install attribution integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/advertising_technologies/attribution/adjust/). If you opt to store your IDFA, we will store it free of charge, so you may take advantage of these options immediately upon release without additional development work.

As a result, we recommend continuing to collect the IDFA if you meet any of the following criteria:

- You are attributing app installation to a previously served advertisement
- You are attributing an action within the application to a previously served advertisement

### iOS 14.5 AppTrackingTransparency

Apple requires users to opt-in through a permission prompt to collect IDFA.

To collect IDFA, in addition to implementing our `ABKIDFADelegate` protocol, your application will need to request authorization from the user using Apple's `ATTrackingManager` in the app tracking transparency framework. Refer to Apple's [user privacy article](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/) for more information.

The prompt for app tracking transparency authorization requires an `Info.plist` entry to explain your usage of the identifier:

```
<key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
<string>To retarget ads and build a global profile to better serve you things you would like.</string>
```

### Implementing IDFA collection

Follow these steps to implement IDFA Collection:

##### Step 1: Implement ABKIDFADelegate

Create a class that conforms to the [`ABKIDFADelegate`](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/blob/master/AppboyKit/include/ABKIDFADelegate.h) protocol:

{% tabs %}
{% tab OBJECTIVE-C %}

```objc
#import "IDFADelegate.h"
#import <AdSupport/ASIdentifierManager.h>
#import <AppTrackingTransparency/AppTrackingTransparency.h>

@implementation IDFADelegate

- (NSString *)advertisingIdentifierString {
  return [[[ASIdentifierManager sharedManager] advertisingIdentifier] UUIDString];
}

- (BOOL)isAdvertisingTrackingEnabledOrATTAuthorized {
  if (@available(iOS 14, *)) {
    return [ATTrackingManager trackingAuthorizationStatus] == ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusAuthorized;
  }
  return [[ASIdentifierManager sharedManager] isAdvertisingTrackingEnabled];
}

@end
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab swift %}

```swift
import Appboy_iOS_SDK
import AdSupport
import AppTrackingTransparency

class IDFADelegate: NSObject, ABKIDFADelegate {
   func advertisingIdentifierString() -> String {
    return ASIdentifierManager.shared().advertisingIdentifier.uuidString
  }

  func isAdvertisingTrackingEnabledOrATTAuthorized() -> Bool {
    if #available(iOS 14, *) {
      return ATTrackingManager.trackingAuthorizationStatus ==  ATTrackingManager.AuthorizationStatus.authorized
    }
    return ASIdentifierManager.shared().isAdvertisingTrackingEnabled
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

##### Step 2: Set the delegate during Braze initialization

In the `appboyOptions` dictionary passed to `startWithApiKey:inApplication:withAppboyOptions:`, set the `ABKIDFADelegateKey` key to an instance of your `ABKIDFADelegate` conforming class.

## Approximate iOS SDK size {#ios-sdk-size}

The approximate iOS SDK framework file size is 30&nbsp;MB, and the approximate .ipa (addition to app file) size is between 1&nbsp;MB and 2&nbsp;MB.

Braze measures the size of our iOS SDK by observing the SDK's effect on `.ipa` size, per Apple's [recommendations on app sizing](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1795/_index.html). If you are calculating the iOS SDK's size addition to your application, we recommend following [Getting an app size report](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1795/_index.html) to compare the size difference in your `.ipa` before and after integrating the Braze iOS SDK. When comparing sizes from the app thinning size report, we also recommend looking at app sizes for thinned `.ipa` files, as universal `.ipa` files will be larger than the binaries downloaded from the App Store and installed onto user devices.

{% alert note %}
If you are integrating via CocoaPods with `use_frameworks!`, set `Enable Bitcode = NO` in target's Build Settings for accurate sizing.
