# Initial SDK setup

> This reference article covers how to install the Braze SDK for tvOS. Installing the Braze SDK will provide you with basic analytics functionality.

{% alert note %}
Our tvOS SDK currently supports analytics functionality. To add a tvOS app in your dashboard, open a [support ticket]({{site.baseurl}}/braze_support/).
{% endalert %}

The tvOS Braze SDK should be installed or updated using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/), a dependency manager for Objective-C and Swift projects. CocoaPods provides added simplicity for integration and updating.

## tvOS SDK CocoaPods integration

### Step 1: Install CocoaPods

Installing the SDK via the tvOS [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) automates the majority of the installation process for you. Before beginning this process, ensure that you are using [Ruby version 2.0.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/) or greater.

Run the following command to get started:

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

- If you are prompted to overwrite the `rake` executable, refer to [Getting started](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html "CocoaPods Installation Directions") on CocoaPods.org for further details.
- If you have issues regarding CocoaPods, refer to the [CocoaPods troubleshooting guide](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/troubleshooting.html "CocoaPods Troubleshooting Guide").

### Step 2: Constructing the Podfile

Now that you've installed the CocoaPods Ruby Gem, you're going to need to create a file in your Xcode project directory named `Podfile`.

Add the following line to your Podfile:

```
target 'YourAppTarget' do
  pod 'Appboy-tvOS-SDK'
end
```

We suggest you version Braze so pod updates automatically grab anything smaller than a minor version update. This looks like `pod 'Appboy-tvOS-SDK' ~> Major.Minor.Build`. If you want to ,automatically integrate the latest Braze SDK version, even with major changes, you can use `pod 'Appboy-tvOS-SDK'` in your Podfile.

### Step 3: Installing the Braze SDK

To install the Braze SDK CocoaPods, navigate to the directory of your Xcode app project within your terminal and run the following command:
```
pod install
```

At this point, you should be able to open the new Xcode project workspace created by CocoaPods. Make sure to use this Xcode workspace instead of your Xcode project.

### Step 4: Updating your app delegate

{% tabs %}
{% tab OBJECTIVE-C %}

Add the following line of code to your `AppDelegate.m` file:

```objc
#import <AppboyTVOSKit/AppboyKit.h>
```

Within your `AppDelegate.m` file, add the following snippet within your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

```objc
[Appboy startWithApiKey:@"YOUR-API-KEY"
         inApplication:application
     withLaunchOptions:launchOptions];
```

Lastly, update `YOUR-API-KEY` with the correct value from your **Manage Settings** page.

{% endtab %}
{% tab swift %}

If you are integrating the Braze SDK with CocoaPods or Carthage, add the following line of code to your `AppDelegate.swift` file:

```swift
import AppboyTVOSKit
```

For more information about using Objective-C code in Swift projects, see the [Apple Developer Docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/buildingcocoaapps/MixandMatch.html).

In `AppDelegate.swift`, add following snippet to your `application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool`:

```swift
Appboy.start(withApiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY", in:application, withLaunchOptions:launchOptions)
```

Next, update `YOUR-API-KEY` with the correct value from your **Manage Settings** page.

Our `sharedInstance` singleton will be nil before `startWithApiKey:` is called, as that is a prerequisite to using any Braze functionality.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% alert warning %}
Be sure to initialize Braze in your application's main thread. Initializing asynchronously can lead to broken functionality.
{% endalert %}

### Step 5: Specify your custom endpoint or data cluster

{% alert note %}
As of December 2019, custom endpoints are no longer given out, if you have a pre-existing custom endpoint, you may continue to use it. For more details, refer to our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/basics/#endpoints">list of available endpoints</a>.
{% endalert %}

Your Braze representative should have already advised you of the [correct endpoint]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/sdk_endpoints/).

#### Compile-time endpoint configuration (recommended)
If given a pre-existing custom endpoint:
- Starting with Braze iOS SDK v3.0.2, you can set a custom endpoint using the `Info.plist` file. Add the `Appboy` dictionary to your Info.plist file. Inside the `Appboy` dictionary, add the `Endpoint` string subentry and set the value to your custom endpoint URLs authority (for example, `sdk.iad-01.braze.com`, not `https://sdk.iad-01.braze.com`).

#### Runtime endpoint configuration
If given a pre-exisiting custom endpoint:
- Starting with Braze iOS SDK v3.17.0+, you can override set your endpoint via the `ABKEndpointKey` inside the `appboyOptions` parameter passed to `startWithApiKey:inApplication:withLaunchOptions:withAppboyOptions:`. Set the value to your custom endpoint URL authority (for example, `sdk.iad-01.braze.com`, not `https://sdk.iad-01.braze.com`).

{% alert note %}
Support for setting endpoints at runtime using `ABKAppboyEndpointDelegate` has been removed in Braze iOS SDK v3.17.0. If you already use `ABKAppboyEndpointDelegate`, note that in Braze iOS SDK versions v3.14.1 to v3.16.0, any reference to `dev.appboy.com` in your `getApiEndpoint()` method must be replaced with a reference to `sdk.iad-01.braze.com`.
{% endalert %}

### SDK integration complete

Braze should now be collecting data from your application, and your basic integration should be complete. Note that when compiling your tvOS app and any other third-party libraries, Bitcode must be enabled.

### Updating the Braze SDK via CocoaPods

To update a CocoaPod, simply run the following commands within your project directory:

```
pod update
```

## Customizing Braze on startup

If you wish to customize Braze on startup, you can instead use the Braze initialization method `startWithApiKey:inApplication:withLaunchOptions:withAppboyOptions` and pass in an optional `NSDictionary` of Braze startup keys.
{% tabs %}
{% tab OBJECTIVE-C %}

In your `AppDelegate.m` file, within your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method, add the following Braze method:

```objc
[Appboy startWithApiKey:@"YOUR-API-KEY"
          inApplication:application
      withLaunchOptions:launchOptions
      withAppboyOptions:appboyOptions];
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab swift %}

In `AppDelegate.swift`, within your `application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool` method, add the following Braze method:

```swift
Appboy.start(withApiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY",
                 in:application,
                 withLaunchOptions:launchOptions,
                 withAppboyOptions:appboyOptions)
```

where `appboyOptions` is a `Dictionary` of startup configuration values.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

This method would replace the `startWithApiKey:inApplication:withLaunchOptions:` initialization method and is called with the following parameters:

- `YOUR-API-KEY`: Your application's API key is found under **Manage Settings** in the Braze dashboard.
- `application`: The current app.
- `launchOptions`: The options `NSDictionary` that you get from `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`.
- `appboyOptions`: An optional `NSDictionary` with startup configuration values for Braze.

See [Appboy.h](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/blob/master/AppboyKit/include/Appboy.h) for a list of Braze startup keys.

## Appboy.sharedInstance() and Swift nullability
Differing somewhat from common practice, the `Appboy.sharedInstance()` singleton is optional. This is because `sharedInstance` is `nil` before `startWithApiKey:` is called, and there are some non-standard but not-invalid implementations in which a delayed initialization can be used.

If you call `startWithApiKey:` in your `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` delegate before any access to Appboy's `sharedInstance` (the standard implementation), you can use optional chaining, like `Appboy.sharedInstance()?.changeUser("testUser")`, to avoid cumbersome checks. This will have parity with an Objective-C implementation that assumed a non-null `sharedInstance`.

## Manual integration options

You can also integrate our tvOS SDK manually - simply grab the Framework from our [Public Repository](https://github.com/appboy/appboy-ios-sdk) and initialize Braze as outlined in the preceding sections.

## Identifying users and reporting analytics
See our [iOS documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/analytics/setting_user_ids/) for information about setting user ids, logging custom events, setting user attributes. We also recommend familiarizing yourself with our [event naming conventions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/event_naming_conventions/).
