# Initial SDK setup

Installing the Braze SDK will provide you with basic analytics functionality as well as working in-app messages with which you can engage your users.

## Android

### Step 1: Get the Xamarin binding

A Xamarin binding is a way to use native libraries in Xamarin apps. The implementation of a binding consists of building a C# interface to the library, and then using that interface in your application.  See the [Xamarin documentation][2].

There are two ways to include the Braze SDK binding:

#### Option 1: Nuget

The simplest integration method involves getting the Braze SDK Bindings from the [Nuget.org][9] central repository. In the Visual Studio sidebar, right click `Packages` folder and click `Add Packages...`.  Search for 'Braze' and install the [`AppboyPlatform.AndroidBinding`][13] package into your project.

#### Option 2: Source

The second integration method is to include the [binding source][3]. Under `appboy-component\src\android` you will find our binding source code; adding a project reference to the ```AppboyPlatform.XamarinAndroidBinding.csproj``` in your Xamarin application will cause the binding to be built with your project and provide you access to the Braze Android SDK.

>  The Braze Nuget package depends on the [`Xamarin.Android.Support.v4`][12] Nuget package.

### Step 2: Configure the Braze SDK in braze.xml
Now that the libraries have been integrated, you have to create an `braze.xml` file in your project's `Resources/values` folder. The contents of that file should resemble the following code snippet:

>  Be sure to substitute `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY` with the API key located the [Settings][4] page of the Braze dashboard.

```java
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <resources>
    <string name="com_braze_api_key">REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY</string>
    <string translatable="false" name="com_braze_custom_endpoint">YOUR_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT_OR_CLUSTER</string>
    <string-array name="com_braze_internal_sdk_metadata">
      <item>XAMARIN</item>
      <item>NUGET</item>
    </string-array>
    </resources>
```
If you are including the binding source manually, remove `<item>NUGET</item>` from your code.

### Step 3: Add required permissions to Android manifest
Now that you've added your API key, you need to add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```

### Step 4: Tracking user sessions and registering for in-App messages
To enable user session tracking and register your app for in-app messages, add the following call to the `OnCreate()` lifecycle method of the `Application` class in your app:

```csharp
RegisterActivityLifecycleCallbacks(new BrazeActivityLifecycleCallbackListener());
```

### SDK integration complete

You should now be able to launch your application and see sessions being logged to the Braze dashboard (along with device information and other analytics).  

> Consult the [Android integration instructions][8] for a more in-depth discussion of best practices for the basic SDK integration.

## iOS

### Step 1: Get the Xamarin binding

A Xamarin binding is a way to use native libraries in Xamarin apps.  The implementation of a binding consists of building a C# interface to the library and then using that interface in your application.

There are two ways to include the Braze SDK binding.

#### Option 1: Nuget

The simplest integration method involves getting the Braze SDK Bindings from the [Nuget.org][19] central repository. In the Visual Studio sidebar, right-click `Packages` folder and click `Add Packages...`.  Search for 'Braze' and install the [`AppboyPlatformXamariniOSBinding`][111] package into your project.

#### Option 2: Source

The second integration method is to include the [binding source][113]. In [our GitHub repo][17] you will find our binding source code; adding a project reference to the ```AppboyPlatformXamariniOSBinding.csproj``` in your Xamarin application will cause the binding to be built with your project and provide you access to the Braze iOS SDK. Make sure `AppboyPlatformXamariniOSBinding` is showing in your project's "Reference" folder.

### Step 2: Update your app delegate and declare Xamarin usage

Within your `AppDelegate.cs` file, add the following snippet within your `FinishedLaunching` method:

>  Be sure to update `YOUR-API-KEY` with the correct value from your [Settings][4] page.

```csharp
// C#
 Appboy.StartWithApiKey ("YOUR-API-KEY", UIApplication.SharedApplication, options);
 Appboy.SharedInstance.SdkFlavor = ABKSDKFlavor.Xamarin;
 Appboy.SharedInstance.AddSdkMetadata(new []{ ABKSdkMetadata.ABKSdkMetadataXamarin, ABKSdkMetadata.ABKSdkMetadataNuGet });
```
If you are including the binding source manually, remove `ABKSdkMetadata.ABKSdkMetadataNuGet` from your code.

**Implementation Example**

See the `AppDelegate.cs` file in the [TestApp.XamariniOS][110] sample app.

### Step 3: Add your SDK endpoint to your info.plist file

Within your `Info.plist` file, add the following snippet:

>  Be sure to update `YOUR-SDK-ENDPOINT` with the correct value from your [Settings][5] page.

```csharp
// C#
<key>Braze</key>
<dict>
 <key>Endpoint</key>
 <string>YOUR-SDK-ENDPOINT</string>
</dict>
```

You can optionally include verbose logging by including the following snippet:

```csharp
// C#
<key>Braze</key>
<dict>
 <key>LogLevel</key>
 <string>0</string>
 <key>Endpoint</key>
 <string>YOUR-SDK-ENDPOINT</string>
</dict>
```

Note that prior to Braze iOS SDK v4.0.2, the dictionary key `Appboy` must be used in place of `Braze`.

### SDK integration complete

Braze should now be collecting data from your application and your basic integration should be complete. See the following articles in order to enable [custom event tracking]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/xamarin/analytics/#tracking-custom-events), [push messaging]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/xamarin/push_notifications/), the [News Feed]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/xamarin/news_feed/) and the complete suite of Braze features.

>  Our current public Xamarin binding for the iOS SDK does not connect to the iOS Facebook SDK (linking social data) and does not include sending the IDFA to Braze.
