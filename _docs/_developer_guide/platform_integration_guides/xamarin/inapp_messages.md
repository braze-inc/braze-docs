# In-app messaging

## Android
See the [Android integration instructions][11] for information on how to integrate in-app messages into your Xamarin Android app.  Furthermore, you can look at the [sample application][12] for implementation samples.

## iOS

In-app messages will work by default if you've included the Appboy.bundle folder in your application.  On Xamarin we don't currently support in-app message custom styling.  If you would like to customize your in-app message UI, implement the ABKInAppMessageControllerDelegate method `ABKInAppMessageViewController InAppMessageViewControllerWithInAppMessage(ABKInAppMessage inAppMessage);` and return your custom view controller. That will make sure Braze passes you the in-app message object rather than displaying it for you. You will then have the option of displaying the in-app message object's content manually.

See the [iOS integration instructions][1] for information on In-App best practices.  Furthermore, you can look at the [sample application][2] for implementation samples.
