{% alert note %}
News Feed is being deprecated. Braze recommends that customers who use our News Feed tool move over to our Content Cards messaging channelâ€”it's more flexible, customizable, and reliable. Check out the [migration guide]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/migrating_from_news_feed/) for more.
{% endalert %}

For information on how to integrate the News Feed into your Xamarin app, see the [Android integration instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/news_feed/integration/) and [iOS integration instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/legacy_sdks/ios/news_feed/integration).
