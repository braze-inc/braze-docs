## About localization

In addition to English, Braze supports several languages for SDK messages displayed in your app. 

When a user's phone language is set to one of the supported languages, SDK messages that are included by default for the messaging channel will be translated to that language. For example, if your app displays a message for connectivity issues, it will be translated to user's chosen language.
