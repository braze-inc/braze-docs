## About localization

In addition to English, Braze supports several languages for our built-in SDK messages displayed in your app.

When a user's phone language is set to one of the supported languages, built-in SDK messages will be translated to that language. For example, if your app displays a message for connectivity issues it will be translated to their chosen language.
