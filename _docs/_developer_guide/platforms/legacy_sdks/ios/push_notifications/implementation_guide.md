# Push notification implementation guide

> This optional and advanced implementation guide covers ways to leverage push notification content app extensions to get the most out of your push messages. Included are three custom use cases built by our team, accompanying code snippets, and guidance on logging analytics. Visit our Braze Demo Repository [here](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-growth-shares-ios-demo-app)! Note that this implementation guide is centered around a Swift implementation, but Objective-C snippets are provided for those interested.

## Notification content app extensions

![Two push messages shown side-by side. The message on the right shows what a push looks like with the default UI. The message on the right shows a coffee punch card push made by implementing a custom push UI.]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push1.png %}){: style="max-width:65%;border:0;margin-top:10px"}

Push notifications while seemingly standard across different platforms, offer immense customization options past what is normally implemented in the default UI. When a push notification is expanded, content notification extensions enable a custom view of the expanded push notification. 

Push notifications can be expanded in three different ways: <br>- A long press on the push banner<br>- Swiping down on the push banner<br>- Swiping the banner to the left and selecting "View" 

These custom views offer smart ways to engage customers allowing you to display many distinct types of content including interactive notifications, notifications populated with user data, and even push messages that can capture information like phone numbers and email. While implementing push in this way may be unfamiliar to some, one of our well-known features at Braze, [Push Stories]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/push/advanced_push_options/push_stories/), are a prime example of what a custom view for a notification content app extension can look like!

#### Requirements
![]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push15.png %}){: style="float:right;max-width:50%;margin-left:10px; border:0;margin-top:10px"}
- [Push notifications]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platforms/legacy_sdks/ios/push_notifications/integration/) successfully integrated in your app
- iOS 10 or higher
- The following files generated by Xcode based on your coding language:

Swift<br>
&#45; `NotificationViewController.swift`<br>
&#45; `MainInterface.storyboard`<br><br>
Objective-C<br>
&#45; `NotificationViewController.h`<br>
&#45; `NotificationViewController.m`<br>
&#45; `MainInterface.storyboard`

### Custom category configuration

To set up a custom view in the dashboard you must toggle on notification buttons and enter your custom category. The pre-registered custom iOS category you provide is then checked against the `UNNotificationExtensionCategory` in the `.plist` of your Notification Content Extension Target. The value given here must match what is set in the Braze dashboard.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push17.png %}){: style="max-width:75%;border:0;margin-top:10px"}

{% alert tip %}
Since pushes with content extensions aren't always apparent, it is recommended to include a call to action to nudge your users to expand their push notifications.
{% endalert %}

## Use case and implementation walkthrough

There are three push notification content app extension types provided. Each type has a concept walkthrough, potential use cases, and a look into how push notification variables may look and be used in the Braze dashboard:
- [Interactive push notification](#interactive-push-notification)
- [Personalized push notifications](#personalized-push-notifications)
- [Information capture push notifications](#information-capture-push-notification)

### Interactive push notification

Push notifications can respond to user actions inside a content extension. For users running iOS 12 or later, this means you can turn your push messages into fully interactive push notifications! This interactivity offers many possibilities to get your users engaged in your notifications. The following example shows a push where users are able to play a match game inside the expanded notification.

![A diagram of what the phases of a interactive push notification could look like. The images show a user pressing into a push notification that displays an interactive matching game.]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push12.png %}){: style="border:0"}

#### Dashboard configuration

To set up a custom view in the dashboard, within the notification button settings enter the specific category you want to display. Next, in the `.plist` of your Notification Content Extension, you must also set the custom category to the `UNNotificationExtensionCategory` attribute. The value given here must match what is set in the Braze dashboard. Lastly, to enable user interactions in a push notification, set the `UNNotificationExtensionInteractionEnabled` key to true.

![The notification button options found in the push message composer settings.]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push14.png %}){: style="max-width:50%;"}

#### Other use cases
Push content extensions are an exciting option to introduce interactivity to your promotions and applications. Some examples include a game for users to play, a spin-to-win wheel for discounts, or a "like" button to save a listing or song.

##### Ready to log analytics?
Visit the [following section](#logging-analytics) to get a better understanding of how the flow of data should look.

### Personalized push notifications
![Two iPhones displayed side-by-side. The first iPhone shows the unexpanded view of the push message. The second iPhone shows the expanded version of the push message displaying a "progress" shot of how far they are through a course, the next session, and when the next session id due by.]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push6.png %}){: style="float:right;max-width:40%;margin-left:15px;border:0"}

Push notifications can display user-specific information inside a content extension. The example to the right shows a push notification after a user has completed a specific task (Braze Learning course) and is now encouraged to expand this notification to check their progress. The information provided here is user-specific and can be fired off as a session is completed or specific user action is taken by leveraging an API trigger. 

#### Dashboard configuration

To set up a personalized push in the dashboard, you must register the specific category you want to be displayed, and then within the key-value pairs using standard Liquid, set the appropriate user attributes you want the message to show. These views can be personalized based on specific user attributes of a specific user profile.

![Four sets of key-value pairs, where "next_session_name" and "next_session_complete_date" are set as an API trigger property using Liquid, and "completed_session count" and "total_session_count" are set as a custom user attribute using Liquid.]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push5.png %}){: style="max-width:60%;"}

#### Handling key-value pairs

The following method, `didReceive` is called when the content extension has received a notification, it can be found within the `NotificationViewController`. The key-value pairs provided in the dashboard are represented in the code through the use of a `userInfo` dictionary.

**Parsing Key-Value Pairs from Push Notifications**<br>

{% tabs %}
{% tab Swift %}
``` swift 
func didReceive(_ notification: UNNotification) {
  let userInfo = notification.request.content.userInfo
     
  guard let value = userInfo["YOUR-KEY-VALUE-PAIR"] as? String,
        let otherValue = userInfo["YOUR-OTHER-KEY-VALUE-PAIR"] as? String,
  else { fatalError("Key-Value Pairs are incorrect.")}
 
  ...
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Objective-C %}
```objc
- (void)didReceiveNotification:(nonnull UNNotification *)notification {
  NSDictionary *userInfo = notification.request.content.userInfo;
   
  if (userInfo[@"YOUR-KEY-VALUE-PAIR"] && userInfo[@"YOUR-OTHER-KEY-VALUE-PAIR"]) {
 
  ...
 
  } else {
    [NSException raise:NSGenericException format:@"Key-Value Pairs are incorrect"];
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Other use cases

The ideas for progress-based and user-focused push content extensions are endless, some examples include adding the option to share your progress across different platforms, expressing achievements unlocked, punch cards, or even onboarding checklists. 

##### Ready to log analytics?
Visit the [following section](#logging-analytics) to get a better understanding of how the flow of data should look.

### Information capture push notification

Push notifications can capture user information inside a content extension, allowing you to push the limits of what is possible with a push. Examining the following flow shown, the view is able to respond to state changes. Those state change components are represented in each image. 

1. User receives a push notification.
2. Push is opened and prompts the user for information.
3. Information is provided and if valid, the register button is shown.
3. Confirmation view is displayed, and push gets dismissed. 

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push8.png %}){: style="border:0;"}

Note that the information requested here can be a wide range of things such as SMS number capture, it doesn't have to be email-specific.

#### Dashboard configuration

To set up an information capture capable push in the dashboard, you must register and set your custom category, and provide the key-value pairs that are needed. As seen in the example, you may also include an image in your push. To do this, you must integrate [rich notifications]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platforms/legacy_sdks/ios/push_notifications/customization/rich_notifications/), set the notification style in your campaign to Rich Notification, and include a rich push image.

![A push message with three sets of key-value pairs. 1. "Braze_id" set as a Liquid call to retrieve Braze ID. 2. "cert_title" set as "Braze Marketer Certification". 3. "Cert_description" set as "Certified Braze marketers drive...".]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push9.png %})

#### Handling button actions

Each action button is uniquely identified. The code checks if your response identifier is equal to the `actionIndentifier`, and if so, knows that the user clicked the action button.

**Handling Push Notification Action Button Responses**<br>

{% tabs %}
{% tab Swift %}
``` swift 
func didReceive(_ response: UNNotificationResponse, completionHandler completion: @escaping (UNNotificationContentExtensionResponseOption) -> Void) {
  if response.actionIdentifier == "YOUR-REGISTER-IDENTIFIER" {
    // do something
  } else {
    // do something else
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Objective-C %}
```objc
- (void)didReceiveNotificationResponse:(UNNotificationResponse *)response completionHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationContentExtensionResponseOption))completion {
  if ([response.actionIdentifier isEqualToString:@"YOUR-REGISTER-IDENTIFIER"]) {
    completion(UNNotificationContentExtensionResponseOptionDismiss);
  } else {
    completion(UNNotificationContentExtensionResponseOptionDoNotDismiss);
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

##### Dismissing pushes

Push notifications can be automatically dismissed from an action button press. There exist three pre-built push dismissal options that are recommended:

1. `completion(.dismiss)` - Dismisses the notification
2. `completion(.doNotDismiss)` - Notification stays open
3. `completion(.dismissAndForward)` - Push dismisses and the user gets forwarded into the application.

#### Other use cases

Requesting user input through push notifications is an exciting opportunity that many companies do not take advantage of. In these push messages, you can not only request basic information like name, email, or number, but you could also prompt users to complete a user profile if unfinished, or even to submit feedback. 

##### Ready to log analytics?
Visit the [following section](#logging-analytics) to get a better understanding of how the flow of data should look. 

## Logging analytics

### Logging with the Braze API (recommended)

Logging analytics can only be done in real-time with the help of the customer's server hitting our [`/users/track` endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track/). To log analytics, send down the `braze_id` value in the key-value pairs field (as seen in the following screenshot) to identify which user profile to update.

![A push message with three sets of key-value pairs. 1. "Braze_id" set as a Liquid call to retrieve Braze ID. 2. "cert_title" set as "Braze Marketer Certification". 3. "Cert_description" set as "Certified Braze marketers drive...".]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push18.png %}){: style="max-width:80%;"}

### Logging manually

Logging manually will require you to first configure App Groups within Xcode, and then create, save, and retrieve analytics. This will require some custom developer work on your end. The following code snippets shown will help address this. 

It's also important to note that analytics are not sent to Braze until the mobile application is subsequently launched. This means that, depending on your dismissal settings, there often exists an indeterminate period of time between when a push notification is dismissed and the mobile app is launched and the analytics are retrieved. While this time buffer may not affect all use cases, users should consider the impact and if necessary, adjust their user journey to include opening the application to address this concern. 

![A graphic describing how analytics are processed in Braze. 1. Analytics data is created. 2. Analytics data is saved. 3. Push notification is dismissed. 4. Indeterminate period of time between when push notification is dismissed and mobile app is launched. 5. Mobile app is launched. 6. Analytics data is received. 7. Analytics data is sent to Braze.]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push13.png %})

#### Step 1: Configure App Groups within Xcode
Add a capability `App Groups`. If you haven't had any app group in your app, go to the capability of the main app target, turn on the `App Groups`, and click the "+". Use your App's bundle ID to create the App Group. For example, if your app's bundle ID is `com.company.appname`, you can name your App Group `group.com.company.appname.xyz`. Make sure the `App Groups` are turned on for both your main app target and the content extension target.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/ios/push_story/add_app_groups.png %})

#### Step 2: Integrate code snippets
The following code snippets are a helpful reference on how to save and send custom events, custom attributes, and user attributes. This guide will be speaking in terms of UserDefaults, but the code representation will be in the form of a helper file  `RemoteStorage`. There also exist additional helper files `UserAttributes` and `EventName Dictionary` that are used when sending and saving user attributes. All helper files can be found at the end of this guide.

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Custom Events %}

##### Saving custom events

To save custom events you must create the analytics from scratch. This is done by creating a dictionary, populating it with metadata, and saving the data through the use of a helper file.

1. Initialize a dictionary with event metadata
2. Initialize `userDefaults` to retrieve and store the event data
3. If there is an existing array, append new data to the existing array and save
4. If there is not an existing array, save the new array to `userDefaults`

{% subtabs global %}
{% subtab Swift %}
``` swift 
func saveCustomEvent(with properties: [String: Any]? = nil) {
  // 1
  let customEventDictionary = Dictionary(eventName: "YOUR-EVENT-NAME", properties: properties)
  
  // 2
  let remoteStorage = RemoteStorage(storageType: .suite)
  
  // 3   
  if var pendingEvents = remoteStorage.retrieve(forKey: .pendingCustomEvents) as? [[String: Any]] {
    pendingEvents.append(contentsOf: [customEventDictionary])
    remoteStorage.store(pendingEvents, forKey: .pendingCustomEvents)
  } else {
  // 4
    remoteStorage.store([customEventDictionary], forKey: .pendingCustomEvents)
  }
}
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab Objective-C %}
```objc
- (void)saveCustomEvent:(NSDictionary<NSString *, id> *)properties {
  // 1 
  NSDictionary<NSString *, id> *customEventDictionary = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithEventName:@"YOUR-EVENT-NAME" properties:properties];
  
  // 2
  RemoteStorage *remoteStorage = [[RemoteStorage alloc] initWithStorageType:StorageTypeSuite];
  NSMutableArray *pendingEvents = [[remoteStorage retrieveForKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingCustomEvents] mutableCopy];
  
  // 3 
  if (pendingEvents) {
    [pendingEvents addObject:customEventDictionary];
    [remoteStorage store:pendingEvents forKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingCustomAttributes];
  } else {
  // 4
    [remoteStorage store:@[ customEventDictionary ] forKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingCustomAttributes];
  }
}
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}

##### Sending custom events to Braze

After the SDK is initialized is the best time to log any saved analytics from a notification content app extension. This can be done by, looping through any pending events, checking for the "Event Name" key, setting the appropriate values in Braze, and then clearing the storage for the next time this function is needed.

1. Loop through the array of pending events
2. Loop through each key-value pair in the `pendingEvents` dictionary
3. Explicitly checking key for "Event Name" to set the value accordingly
4. Every other key-value will be added to the `properties` dictionary
5. Log individual custom event 
6. Remove all pending events from storage

{% subtabs global %}
{% subtab Swift %}
``` swift 
func logPendingCustomEventsIfNecessary() {
  let remoteStorage = RemoteStorage(storageType: .suite)
  guard let pendingEvents = remoteStorage.retrieve(forKey: .pendingCustomEvents) as? [[String: Any]] else { return }
  
  // 1    
  for event in pendingEvents {
    var eventName: String?
    var properties: [AnyHashable: Any] = [:]
    
  // 2
    for (key, value) in event {
      if key == PushNotificationKey.eventName.rawValue {
  // 3      
        if let eventNameValue = value as? String {
          eventName = eventNameValue
        } else {
          print("Invalid type for event_name key")
        }
      } else {
  // 4 
        properties[key] = value
      }
    }
  // 5    
    if let eventName = eventName {
      logCustomEvent(eventName, withProperties: properties)
    }
  }

  // 6    
  remoteStorage.removeObject(forKey: .pendingCustomEvents)
}
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab Objective-C %}
```objc
- (void)logPendingEventsIfNecessary {
  RemoteStorage *remoteStorage = [[RemoteStorage alloc] initWithStorageType:StorageTypeSuite];
  NSArray *pendingEvents = [remoteStorage retrieveForKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingCustomEvents];
  
  // 1 
  for (NSDictionary<NSString *, id> *event in pendingEvents) {
    NSString *eventName = nil;
    NSMutableDictionary *properties = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
    
  // 2 
    for (NSString* key in event) {
      if ([key isEqualToString:@"event_name"]) {
  // 3       
        if ([[event objectForKey:key] isKindOfClass:[NSString class]]) {
          eventName = [event objectForKey:key];
        } else {
          NSLog(@"Invalid type for event_name key");
        }
      } else {
  // 4 
        properties[key] = event[key];
      }
    }
  // 5  
    if (eventName != nil) {
      [[Appboy sharednstance] logCustomEvent:eventName withProperties:properties];
    }
  }

  // 6  
  [remoteStorage removeObjectForKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingCustomEvents];
}
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab Custom Attributes %}

##### Saving custom attributes

To save custom attributes you must create the analytics from scratch. This is done by creating a dictionary, populating it with metadata, and saving the data through the use of a helper file.

1. Initialize a dictionary with attribute metadata
2. Initialize `userDefaults` to retrieve and store the attribute data
3. If there is an existing array, append new data to the existing array and save
4. If there is not an existing array, save the new array to `userDefaults`

{% subtabs global %}
{% subtab Swift %}
``` swift 
func saveCustomAttribute() {
  // 1 
  let customAttributeDictionary: [String: Any] = ["YOUR-CUSTOM-ATTRIBUTE-KEY": "YOUR-CUSTOM-ATTRIBUTE-VALUE"]
  
  // 2 
  let remoteStorage = RemoteStorage(storageType: .suite)
  
  // 3 
  if var pendingAttributes = remoteStorage.retrieve(forKey: .pendingCustomAttributes) as? [[String: Any]] {
    pendingAttributes.append(contentsOf: [customAttributeDictionary])
    remoteStorage.store(pendingAttributes, forKey: .pendingCustomAttributes)
  } else {
  // 4 
    remoteStorage.store([customAttributeDictionary], forKey: .pendingCustomAttributes)
  }
}
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab Objective-C %}
``` objc
- (void)saveCustomAttribute {
  // 1 
  NSDictionary<NSString *, id> *customAttributeDictionary = @{ @"YOUR-CUSTOM-ATTRIBUTE-KEY": @"YOUR-CUSTOM-ATTRIBUTE-VALUE" };
  
  // 2  
  RemoteStorage *remoteStorage = [[RemoteStorage alloc] initWithStorageType:StorageTypeSuite];
  NSMutableArray *pendingAttributes = [[remoteStorage retrieveForKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingCustomAttributes] mutableCopy];
  
  // 3
  if (pendingAttributes) {
    [pendingAttributes addObject:customAttributeDictionary];
    [remoteStorage store:pendingAttributes forKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingCustomAttributes];
  } else {
  // 4 
    [remoteStorage store:@[ customAttributeDictionary ] forKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingCustomAttributes];
  }
}
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}

##### Sending custom attributes to Braze

After the SDK is initialized is the best time to log any saved analytics from a notification content app extension. This can be done by looping through the pending attributes, setting the appropriate custom attribute in Braze, and then clearing the storage for the next time this function is needed.

1. Loop through the array of pending attributes
2. Loop through each key-value pair in the `pendingAttributes` dictionary
3. Log individual custom attribute with corresponding key and value
4. Remove all pending attributes from storage

{% subtabs global %}
{% subtab Swift %}
``` swift 
func logPendingCustomAttributesIfNecessary() {
  let remoteStorage = RemoteStorage(storageType: .suite)
  guard let pendingAttributes = remoteStorage.retrieve(forKey: .pendingCustomAttributes) as? [[String: Any]] else { return }
     
  // 1
  pendingAttributes.forEach { setCustomAttributesWith(keysAndValues: $0) }
  
  // 4 
  remoteStorage.removeObject(forKey: .pendingCustomAttributes)
}
   
func setCustomAttributesWith(keysAndValues: [String: Any]) {
  // 2 
  for (key, value) in keysAndValues {
  // 3
    if let value = value as? [String] {
      setCustomAttributeArrayWithKey(key, andValue: value)
    } else {
      setCustomAttributeWithKey(key, andValue: value)
    }
  }
}
```

    [self setCustomAttributeWith:key andValue:[keysAndValues objectForKey:key]];
  }
}
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab User Attributes %}

##### Saving user attributes

When saving user attributes, it is recommended to create a custom object to decipher what type of attribute is being updated (`email`, `first_name`, `phone_number`, etc.). The object should be compatible with being stored/retrieved from `UserDefaults`. See the `UserAttribute` helper file for one example of how to accomplish this.

1. Initialize an encoded `UserAttribute` object with the corresponding type
2. Initialize `userDefaults` to retrieve and store the event data
3. If there is an existing array, append new data to the existing array and save
4. If there is not an existing array, save the new array to `userDefaults`

{% subtabs global %}
{% subtab Swift %}
``` swift 
func saveUserAttribute() {
  // 1 
  guard let data = try? PropertyListEncoder().encode(UserAttribute.userAttributeType("USER-ATTRIBUTE-VALUE")) else { return }
  
  // 2       
  let remoteStorage = RemoteStorage(storageType: .suite)
  
  // 3    
  if var pendingAttributes = remoteStorage.retrieve(forKey: .pendingUserAttributes) as? [Data] {
    pendingAttributes.append(contentsOf: [data])
    remoteStorage.store(pendingAttributes, forKey: .pendingUserAttributes)
  } else {
  // 4 
    remoteStorage.store([data], forKey: .pendingUserAttributes)
  }
}
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab Objective-C %}
```objc
- (void)saveUserAttribute {

  NSError *error;
  NSData *data = [NSKeyedArchiver archivedDataWithRootObject:userAttribute requiringSecureCoding:YES error:&error];

  if (error != nil) {
    // log error
  }
  // 2

    [remoteStorage store:pendingAttributes forKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingUserAttributes];
  } else {

2. Initialize an encoded `UserAttribute` object from attribute data
3. Set specific user field based on the User Attribute type (email)
4. Remove all pending user attributes from storage
