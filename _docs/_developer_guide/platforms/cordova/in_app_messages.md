# In-app messages

> [In-app messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/) help you get content to your user without interrupting their day with a push notification. Customized and tailored in-app messages enhance the user experience and help your audience get the most value from your app. With a variety of layouts and customization tools to choose from, in-app messages engage your users more than ever before. For in-app message examples, check out our [case studies](https://www.braze.com/customers).

## Setting up in-app messages 

By default the Cordova SDK supports in-app messages with no changes. See the [Android]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platforms/android/in_app_messages/) or [iOS]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platforms/swift/in_app_messages/) integration examples for information on customizing in-app messages. Furthermore, you can look at the [sample Cordova application](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-cordova-sdk/blob/master/sample-project/www/js/index.js) or the sample [Android](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk) or [iOS](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk) application for implementation samples.
