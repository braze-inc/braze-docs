# Example push notification implementations

> This optional, advanced implementation guide covers ways to leverage notification content app extensions to get the most out of your push messages. 

This guide provides three example implementations of notification content app extensions, each with a concept walkthrough, potential use cases, and a look into how push notification variables may look and be used in the Braze dashboard:
- [Interactive push notification](#interactive-push-notification)
- [Personalized push notifications](#personalized-push-notifications)
- [Information capture push notifications](#information-capture-push-notification)

This article also provides [guidance on logging analytics](#logging-analytics) for these custom implementations.

{% alert note %}
This implementation guide is centered around a Swift implementation, but Objective-C snippets are provided for those interested.

## Notification content app extensions

![Two push messages shown side-by side. The message on the left shows what a push looks like with the default UI. The message on the right shows a coffee punch card push made by implementing a custom push UI.]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push1.png %}){: style="max-width:65%;border:0;margin-top:10px"}

Notification content app extensions provide you a great option for push notification customization. Notification content app extensions display a custom interface for your app’s notifications when a push notification is expanded. 

Push notifications can be expanded in three different ways:
- A long press on the push banner
- Swiping down on the push banner
- Swiping the banner to the left and selecting "View" 

These custom views offer smart ways to engage customers by displaying distinct types of content, including interactive notifications, notifications populated with user data, and even push messages that can capture information like phone numbers and email. One of our well-known features at Braze, [Push Stories]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/push/advanced_push_options/push_stories/), are a prime example of what a push notification content app extension can look like!

### Requirements

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push15.png %}){: style="float:right;max-width:50%;margin-left:10px; border:0;margin-top:10px"}
- [Push notifications]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platforms/swift/push_notifications/) successfully integrated in your app
- The following files generated by Xcode based on your coding language:

**Swift**<br>
- `NotificationViewController.swift`
- `MainInterface.storyboard`

**Objective-C**<br>
- `NotificationViewController.h`
- `NotificationViewController.m`
- `MainInterface.storyboard`

## Interactive push notification

Push notifications can respond to user actions inside a content app extension. For users running iOS 12 or later, this means you can turn your push notifications into fully interactive messages! This provides an exciting option to introduce interactivity to your promotions and applications. For example, your push notification can include a game for users to play, a spin-to-win wheel for discounts, or a "like" button to save a listing or song.

The following example shows a push notification where users are able to play a match game inside the expanded notification.

![A diagram of what the phases of a interactive push notification could look like. A sequence shows a user pressing into a push notification that displays an interactive matching game.]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push12.png %}){: style="border:0"}

### Dashboard configuration

To create an interactive push notification, you must set a custom view in your dashboard. 

1. From the **Campaigns** page, click  **Create Campaign** to start a new push notification campaign.
2. On the **Compose** tab, toggle on **Notification Buttons**. 
3. Enter a custom iOS category in the **iOS Notification Category** field. 
4. In the `.plist` of your Notification Content Extension Target, set the `UNNotificationExtensionCategory` attribute to your custom iOS category. The value given here must match what is set in the Braze dashboard under **iOS Notification Category**. 
5. Set the `UNNotificationExtensionInteractionEnabled` key to `true` to enable user interactions in a push notification.

## Personalized push notifications
![Two iPhones displayed side-by-side. The first iPhone shows the unexpanded view of the push message. The second iPhone shows the expanded version of the push message displaying a "progress" shot of how far they are through a course, the name of the next session, and when the next session must be completed.]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push6.png %}){: style="float:right;max-width:40%;margin-left:15px;border:0"}

Push notifications can display user-specific information inside a content extension. This allows you to create user-focused push content, such as adding the option to share your progress across different platforms, show unlocked achievements, or display onboarding checklists. This example shows a push notification displayed to a user after they have completed a specific task in the Braze Learning course. By expanding the notification, the user can see their progress through their learning path. The information provided here is user-specific and can be fired off as a session is completed or a specific user action is taken by leveraging an API trigger. 

### Dashboard configuration

To create a personalized push notification, you must set a custom view in your dashboard. 

1. From the **Campaigns** page, click  **Create Campaign** to start a new push notification campaign.
2. On the **Compose** tab, toggle on **Notification Buttons**. 
3. Enter a custom iOS category in the **iOS Notification Category** field. 
4. In the **Settings** tab, create key-value pairs using standard Liquid. Set the appropriate user attributes you want the message to show. These views can be personalized based on specific user attributes of a specific user profile.
5. In the `.plist` of your Notification Content Extension Target, set the `UNNotificationExtensionCategory` attribute to your custom iOS category. The value given here must match what is set in the Braze dashboard under **iOS Notification Category**. 

![Four sets of key-value pairs, where "next_session_name" and "next_session_complete_date" are set as an API trigger property using Liquid, and "completed_session count" and "total_session_count" are set as a custom user attribute using Liquid.]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push5.png %}){: style="max-width:60%;"}

### Handling key-value pairs

The method `didReceive` is called when the notification content app extension has received a notification. This method can be found within the `NotificationViewController`. The key-value pairs provided in the dashboard are represented in the code through the use of a `userInfo` dictionary.

#### Parsing Key-Value Pairs from Push Notifications

{% tabs %}
{% tab Swift %}
``` swift 
func didReceive(_ notification: UNNotification) {
  let userInfo = notification.request.content.userInfo
     
  guard let value = userInfo["YOUR-KEY-VALUE-PAIR"] as? String,
        let otherValue = userInfo["YOUR-OTHER-KEY-VALUE-PAIR"] as? String,
  else { fatalError("Key-Value Pairs are incorrect.")}
 
  ...
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Objective-C %}
```objc
- (void)didReceiveNotification:(nonnull UNNotification *)notification {
  NSDictionary *userInfo = notification.request.content.userInfo;
   
  if (userInfo[@"YOUR-KEY-VALUE-PAIR"] && userInfo[@"YOUR-OTHER-KEY-VALUE-PAIR"]) {
 
  ...
 
  } else {
    [NSException raise:NSGenericException format:@"Key-Value Pairs are incorrect"];
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Information capture push notification

Push notifications can capture user information inside a content app extension, pushing the limits of what is possible with a push. Requesting user input through push notifications allows you to not only request basic information like name or email, but also prompt users to submit feedback or complete an unfinished user profile. 

In the following flow, the custom view is able to respond to state changes. Those state change components are represented in each image. 

1. User receives a push notification.
2. Push is opened. After expanded, the push prompts the user for information. In this example, the user's email address is requested, but you could request any sort of information.
3. Information is provided, and if in the expected format, the registration button is shown.
3. Confirmation view is displayed, and push gets dismissed. 

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push8.png %}){: style="border:0;"}

### Dashboard configuration

To create an information capture push notification, you must set a custom view in your dashboard. 

1. From the **Campaigns** page, click  **Create Campaign** to start a new push notification campaign.
2. On the **Compose** tab, toggle on **Notification Buttons**. 
3. Enter a custom iOS category in the **iOS Notification Category** field. 
4. In the **Settings** tab, create key-value pairs using standard Liquid. Set the appropriate user attributes you want the message to show. 
5. In the `.plist` of your Notification Content Extension Target, set the `UNNotificationExtensionCategory` attribute to your custom iOS category. The value given here must match what is set in the Braze dashboard under **iOS Notification Category**. 

As seen in the example, you may also include an image in your push notification. To do this, you must integrate [rich notifications]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platforms/swift/push_notifications/rich/), set the notification style in your campaign to Rich Notification, and include a rich push image.

![A push message with three sets of key-value pairs. 1. "Braze_id" set as a Liquid call to retrieve Braze ID. 2. "cert_title" set as "Braze Marketer Certification". 3. "Cert_description" set as "Certified Braze marketers drive...".]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push9.png %})

### Handling button actions

Each action button is uniquely identified. The code checks if your response identifier is equal to the `actionIndentifier`, and if so, knows that the user clicked the action button.

**Handling Push Notification Action Button Responses**<br>

{% tabs %}
{% tab Swift %}
``` swift 
func didReceive(_ response: UNNotificationResponse, completionHandler completion: @escaping (UNNotificationContentExtensionResponseOption) -> Void) {
  if response.actionIdentifier == "YOUR-REGISTER-IDENTIFIER" {
    // do something
  } else {
    // do something else
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Objective-C %}
```objc
- (void)didReceiveNotificationResponse:(UNNotificationResponse *)response completionHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationContentExtensionResponseOption))completion {
  if ([response.actionIdentifier isEqualToString:@"YOUR-REGISTER-IDENTIFIER"]) {
    completion(UNNotificationContentExtensionResponseOptionDismiss);
  } else {
    completion(UNNotificationContentExtensionResponseOptionDoNotDismiss);
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Dismissing pushes

Push notifications can be automatically dismissed from an action button press. There are three pre-built push dismissal options that we recommend:

1. `completion(.dismiss)` - Dismisses the notification
2. `completion(.doNotDismiss)` - Notification stays open
3. `completion(.dismissAndForward)` - Push dismisses and the user gets forwarded into the application

### Ready to log analytics?
Visit the [following section](#logging-analytics) to get a better understanding of how the flow of data should look. 

## Logging analytics

### Logging with the Braze API (recommended)

Logging analytics can be done in real-time with the help of the Braze API [`/users/track` endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track/). To log analytics, send down the `braze_id` value in the key-value pairs field (as seen in the following screenshot) to identify which user profile to update.

![A push message with three sets of key-value pairs. 1. "Braze_id" set as a Liquid call to retrieve Braze ID. 2. "cert_title" set as "Braze Marketer Certification". 3. "Cert_description" set as "Certified Braze marketers drive...".]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push18.png %}){: style="max-width:80%;"}

### Logging manually

Logging manually will require you to first configure workspaces within Xcode, and then create, save, and retrieve analytics. This will require some custom developer work on your end. The following code snippets shown will help address this. 

It's important to note that analytics are not sent to Braze until the mobile application is subsequently launched. This means that, depending on your dismissal settings, there often exists an indeterminate period of time between when a push notification is dismissed and the mobile app is launched and the analytics are retrieved. While this time buffer may not affect all use cases, you should consider this impact adjust your user journey as necessary to include opening the application to address this concern. 

![A graphic describing how analytics are processed in Braze. 1. Analytics data is created. 2. Analytics data is saved. 3. Push notification is dismissed. 4. Indeterminate period of time between when push notification is dismissed and mobile app is launched. 5. Mobile app is launched. 6. Analytics data is received. 7. Analytics data is sent to Braze.]({% image_buster /assets/img/push_implementation_guide/push13.png %})

#### Step 1: Configure app groups within Xcode
In Xcode, add the `App Groups` capability. If you haven’t had any workspaces in your app, go to the capability of the main app target, turn on the `App Groups`, and click the **+** Add button. Then, use your app’s bundle ID to create the workspace. For example, if your app’s bundle ID is `com.company.appname`, you can name your workspace `group.com.company.appname.xyz`. Make sure the `App Groups` are turned on for both your main app target and the content extension target.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/swift/push_story/add_app_groups.png %})

#### Step 2: Integrate code snippets
The following code snippets are a helpful reference on how to save and send custom events, custom attributes, and user attributes. This guide will be speaking in terms of `UserDefaults`, but the code representation will be in the form of the helper file `RemoteStorage`. There are additional helper files, `UserAttributes` and `EventName Dictionary`, that are used when sending and saving user attributes.

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Custom Events %}

##### Saving custom events

To save custom events, you must create the analytics from scratch. This is done by creating a dictionary, populating it with metadata, and saving the data through the use of a helper file.

1. Initialize a dictionary with event metadata
2. Initialize `userDefaults` to retrieve and store the event data
3. If there is an existing array, append new data to the existing array and save
4. If there is not an existing array, save the new array to `userDefaults`

{% subtabs global %}
{% subtab Swift %}
``` swift 
func saveCustomEvent(with properties: [String: Any]? = nil) {
  // 1
  let customEventDictionary = Dictionary(eventName: "YOUR-EVENT-NAME", properties: properties)
  
  // 2
  let remoteStorage = RemoteStorage(storageType: .suite)
  
  // 3   
  if var pendingEvents = remoteStorage.retrieve(forKey: .pendingCustomEvents) as? [[String: Any]] {
    pendingEvents.append(contentsOf: [customEventDictionary])
    remoteStorage.store(pendingEvents, forKey: .pendingCustomEvents)
  } else {
  // 4
    remoteStorage.store([customEventDictionary], forKey: .pendingCustomEvents)
  }
}
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab Objective-C %}
```objc
- (void)saveCustomEvent:(NSDictionary<NSString *, id> *)properties {
  // 1 
  NSDictionary<NSString *, id> *customEventDictionary = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithEventName:@"YOUR-EVENT-NAME" properties:properties];
  
  // 2
  RemoteStorage *remoteStorage = [[RemoteStorage alloc] initWithStorageType:StorageTypeSuite];
  NSMutableArray *pendingEvents = [[remoteStorage retrieveForKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingCustomEvents] mutableCopy];
  
  // 3 
  if (pendingEvents) {
    [pendingEvents addObject:customEventDictionary];
    [remoteStorage store:pendingEvents forKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingCustomAttributes];
  } else {
  // 4
    [remoteStorage store:@[ customEventDictionary ] forKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingCustomAttributes];
  }
}
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}

##### Sending custom events to Braze

The best time to log any saved analytics from a notification content app extension is right after the SDK is initialized. This can be done by looping through any pending events, checking for the "Event Name" key, setting the appropriate values in Braze, and then clearing the storage for the next time this function is needed.

1. Loop through the array of pending events
2. Loop through each key-value pair in the `pendingEvents` dictionary
3. Explicitly check the key for “Event Name” to set the value accordingly
4. Every other key-value will be added to the `properties` dictionary
5. Log individual custom event 
6. Remove all pending events from storage

{% subtabs global %}
{% subtab Swift %}
``` swift 
func logPendingCustomEventsIfNecessary() {
  let remoteStorage = RemoteStorage(storageType: .suite)
  guard let pendingEvents = remoteStorage.retrieve(forKey: .pendingCustomEvents) as? [[String: Any]] else { return }
  
  // 1    
  for event in pendingEvents {
    var eventName: String?
    var properties: [AnyHashable: Any] = [:]
    
  // 2
    for (key, value) in event {
      if key == PushNotificationKey.eventName.rawValue {
  // 3      
        if let eventNameValue = value as? String {
          eventName = eventNameValue
        } else {
          print("Invalid type for event_name key")
        }
      } else {
  // 4 
        properties[key] = value
      }
    }
  // 5    
    if let eventName = eventName {
      AppDelegate.braze?.logCustomEvent(eventName, properties: properties)
    }
  }

  // 6    
  remoteStorage.removeObject(forKey: .pendingCustomEvents)
}
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab Objective-C %}
```objc
- (void)logPendingEventsIfNecessary {
  RemoteStorage *remoteStorage = [[RemoteStorage alloc] initWithStorageType:StorageTypeSuite];
  NSArray *pendingEvents = [remoteStorage retrieveForKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingCustomEvents];
  
  // 1 
  for (NSDictionary<NSString *, id> *event in pendingEvents) {
    NSString *eventName = nil;
    NSMutableDictionary *properties = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
    
  // 2 
    for (NSString* key in event) {
      if ([key isEqualToString:@"event_name"]) {
  // 3       
        if ([[event objectForKey:key] isKindOfClass:[NSString class]]) {
          eventName = [event objectForKey:key];
        } else {
          NSLog(@"Invalid type for event_name key");
        }
      } else {
  // 4 
        properties[key] = event[key];
      }
    }
  // 5  
    if (eventName != nil) {
      [AppDelegate.braze logCustomEvent:eventName properties:properties];
    }
  }

  // 6  
  [remoteStorage removeObjectForKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingCustomEvents];
}
```

{% tab Custom Attributes %}

##### Saving custom attributes

To save custom attributes, you must create the analytics from scratch. This is done by creating a dictionary, populating it with metadata, and saving the data through the use of a helper file.

1. Initialize a dictionary with attribute metadata
2. Initialize `userDefaults` to retrieve and store the attribute data
3. If there is an existing array, append new data to the existing array and save
4. If there is not an existing array, save the new array to `userDefaults`

{% subtabs global %}
{% subtab Swift %}
``` swift 
func saveCustomAttribute() {
  // 1 
  let customAttributeDictionary: [String: Any] = ["YOUR-CUSTOM-ATTRIBUTE-KEY": "YOUR-CUSTOM-ATTRIBUTE-VALUE"]
  
  // 2 
  let remoteStorage = RemoteStorage(storageType: .suite)
  
  // 3 
  if var pendingAttributes = remoteStorage.retrieve(forKey: .pendingCustomAttributes) as? [[String: Any]] {
    pendingAttributes.append(contentsOf: [customAttributeDictionary])
    remoteStorage.store(pendingAttributes, forKey: .pendingCustomAttributes)
  } else {
  // 4 
    remoteStorage.store([customAttributeDictionary], forKey: .pendingCustomAttributes)
  }
}
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab Objective-C %}
``` objc
- (void)saveCustomAttribute {
  // 1 
  NSDictionary<NSString *, id> *customAttributeDictionary = @{ @"YOUR-CUSTOM-ATTRIBUTE-KEY": @"YOUR-CUSTOM-ATTRIBUTE-VALUE" };
  
  // 2  
  RemoteStorage *remoteStorage = [[RemoteStorage alloc] initWithStorageType:StorageTypeSuite];
  NSMutableArray *pendingAttributes = [[remoteStorage retrieveForKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingCustomAttributes] mutableCopy];
  
  // 3
  if (pendingAttributes) {
    [pendingAttributes addObject:customAttributeDictionary];
    [remoteStorage store:pendingAttributes forKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingCustomAttributes];
  } else {
  // 4 
    [remoteStorage store:@[ customAttributeDictionary ] forKey:RemoteStorageKeyPendingCustomAttributes];
  }
}
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}

##### Sending custom attributes to Braze

The best time to log any saved analytics from a notification content app extension is right after the SDK is initialized. This can be done by looping through the pending attributes, setting the appropriate custom attribute in Braze, and then clearing the storage for the next time this function is needed.

1. Loop through the array of pending attributes
2. Loop through each key-value pair in the `pendingAttributes` dictionary
3. Log individual custom attributes with corresponding key and value
4. Remove all pending attributes from storage

{% subtabs global %}
{% subtab Swift %}
``` swift 
func logPendingCustomAttributesIfNecessary() {

  // 3
    if let value = value as? [String] {
      setCustomAttributeArrayWithKey(key, andValue: value)
    } else {
      setCustomAttributeWithKey(key, andValue: value)
    }
  }

    [self setCustomAttributeWith:key andValue:[keysAndValues objectForKey:key]];
  }
}
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab User Attributes %}

##### Saving user attributes

When saving user attributes, we recommend creating a custom object to decipher what type of attribute is being updated (`email`, `first_name`, `phone_number`, etc.). The object should be compatible with being stored/retrieved from `UserDefaults`. See the `UserAttribute` helper file for one example of how to accomplish this.

1. Initialize an encoded `UserAttribute` object with the corresponding type
2. Initialize `userDefaults` to retrieve and store the event data
3. If there is an existing array, append new data to the existing array and save
4. If there is not an existing array, save the new array to `userDefaults`

{% subtabs global %}
{% subtab Swift %}
``` swift 
func saveUserAttribute() {
  // 1 
  guard let data = try? PropertyListEncoder().encode(UserAttribute.userAttributeType("USER-ATTRIBUTE-VALUE")) else { return }
  
  // 2       
  let remoteStorage = RemoteStorage(storageType: .suite)
  
  // 3    
  if var pendingAttributes = remoteStorage.retrieve(forKey: .pendingUserAttributes) as? [Data] {
    pendingAttributes.append(contentsOf: [data])
    remoteStorage.store(pendingAttributes, forKey: .pendingUserAttributes)
  } else {
  // 4

  }
}
