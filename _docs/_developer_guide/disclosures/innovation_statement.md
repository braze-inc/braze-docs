# Innovation Statement

_Last updated September 2022._

Braze continually strives to enhance existing, and create new, features, functionality, products and services. To do so, Braze not only seeks feedback from its customers, but also endeavors to anticipate its customers' needs.

As part of its innovation strategy, Braze analyzes information contained in the Braze Services and how the Braze Services are used (e.g., analysis of User clicks and movements across the dashboard), in order to provide consultative and analytical information to its customers generally, and in order to build, provide or improve its services, provided that this use does not include building or modifying End User profiles to use in providing services to another customer, or correcting or augmenting data acquired by Braze from another source.

Braze also communicates with (dashboard) Users to educate and inform them of ways to optimize their use of the Services and to share Braze's innovation efforts. Braze may send emails to (dashboard) Users or communicate with them through the dashboard. Customers can also subscribe to Braze's GitHub repositories to receive notifications when new releases are made.

Braze owns all right, title and interest in and to any material resulting from such activities.
