These are performed by independent, third-party auditors. We are compliant with these internationally-recognized standards and codes of practice to ensure that our security standards are up-to-date and in line with leading best practices.

Braze's HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) cluster complies with the [Security and Privacy rules of HIPAA](https://aspe.hhs.gov/report/health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act-1996), as applicable. When creating this cluster, Braze worked with a lawyer who advised on HIPAA laws and worked through the compliance needs for HIPAA with respect to the Security and Privacy rules. This included a risk analysis for the environment, as well as going through each safeguard and ensuring compliance as required.
