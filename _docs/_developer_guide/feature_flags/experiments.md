# Feature flag experiments

> Feature flag experiments let you A/B test changes to your applications to optimize conversion rates. Marketers can use feature flags to determine whether a new feature positively or negatively impacts conversion rates, or which set of feature flag properties is most optimal.

## Prerequisites

Before you can track user data in the experiment, your app needs to record when a user interacts with a feature flag. This is called a feature flag impression. Make sure to log a feature flag impression whenever a user sees or could have seen the feature you're testing, even if they're in the control group.

To learn more about logging feature flag impressions, see [Creating feature flags]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_wide/feature_flags/create/#impressions).

```javascript
const featureFlag = braze.getFeatureFlag("my-new-feature");
braze.logFeatureFlagImpression("my-new-feature");
if (featureFlag?.enabled) {
   return <NewFeature />
} else {
   return <ExistingFeature />
}

```

## Creating a feature flag experiment

### Step 1: Create an experiment

1. Go to **Messaging** > **Campaigns**, then select **+ Create Campaign**.
2. Select **Feature Flag Experiment**.
3. Give your campaign a clear and meaningful name.

### Step 2: Add experiment variants

Next, create variations. For each variant, choose the feature flag you want to turn on or off, then review its assigned properties.

To test the impact of your feature, use variants to split traffic into two or more groups. Name one group "My control group" and turn its feature flags off.

### Step 3: Overwrite properties (optional)

You can choose to overwrite the default properties you initially set up for users who receive a specific campaign variant.

To edit, add, or remove additional default properties, edit the feature flag itself from **Messaging** > **Feature Flags**. When a variant is disabled, the SDK will return an empty properties object for the given feature flag.

### Step 4: Choose users to target

Use one of your segments or filters to choose your [target users]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/building_campaigns/targeting_users/). For example, you can use the **Received Feature Flag Variant** filter to retarget users who have already received an A/B test.

{% alert note %}
Segment membership is calculated when feature flags are refreshed for a given user. Changes are made available after your app refreshes feature flags, or when a new session is started.
{% endalert %}

### Step 5: Distribute variants

Choose the percentage distribution for your experiment. As a best practice, you should not change the distribution after your experiment has been launched.

### Step 6: Assign conversions

Braze lets you to track how often users perform specific actions, [conversion events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/building_campaigns/conversion_events/), after receiving a campaign. Specify up to a 30-day window during which a conversion will be counted if the user takes the specified action.

### Step 7: Review and launch

After youâ€™ve finished building the last of your experiment, review its details, then select **Launch Experiment**.

## Reviewing the results

After your feature flag experiment is finished, you can review impression data for your experiment. Go to **Messaging** > **Campaigns** and select the campaign with your feature flag experiment.

### Campaign analytics

**Campaign Analytics** offers a high-level overview of your experiment's performance, such as:

- The total number of impressions
- The number of unique impressions
- The primary conversion rate
- The total revenue generated by the message
- The estimated audience

You can also view the experiment's settings for delivery, audience, and conversion.

### Feature flag experiment performance

**Feature Flags Experiments Performance** shows how well your message performed across various dimensions. The specific metrics you see will vary depending on your chosen messaging channel, and whether you're running a multivariate test. To see the feature flag values associated with each variant, select **Preview**.
