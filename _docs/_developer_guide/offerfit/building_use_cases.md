# Building use cases

> Learn how to build an OfferFit use case, so you can automate personalized experimentation and optimize outcomes like conversions, retention, or revenue&#8212;without manual A/B testing.

## About use cases

A use case is a custom configuration for OfferFitâ€™s AI decisioning engine that's tailor-made to meet a specific business goal.

For example, you could build a repeat purchase use case to increase follow-up conversions after an initial sale. You define the audience and message in Braze, while OfferFit runs daily experiments and automatically tests different combinations of product offers, message timing, and frequency for each customer. Over time, OfferFit learns what works best and orchestrates personalized sends through Braze to maximize repurchase rates.

To build a good use case, you'll:

- Choose a success metric for OfferFit to optimize for, such as revenue, conversions, or ARPU.
- Define which dimensions to test, such as offer, subject line, creative, channel, or send time.
- Select the options for each dimension, such as email vs. SMS or daily vs. weekly frequency.

The OfferFit AI will learn from every customer interaction and apply those insights to the next day's recommendations.

## Building a use case

### Prerequisites

Before you can build a use case, you'll need to [integrate OfferFit by Braze]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/offerfit/integration).

### Step 1: Contact OfferFit

You'll work with the OfferFit team to build your use case. If you haven't already, reach out to your customer success manager to get started. They'll walk you through the following steps to help build a custom use case that's right for you.

### Step 2: Define a target audience

<!-- Content in this step largely unedited. Will be tackled monday. -->

Define your target audience by creating at least one segment in Braze. This segment will be used to send your campaign or Canvas to the right users.

### Step 3: Set up API-triggered delivery

<!-- Content in this step largely unedited. Will be tackled monday. -->

Next, you'll create an API-triggered Braze campaign or Canvas and create campaign assets (for example, HTML templates, images).

1. Create a [campaign]({{site.baseurl}}//user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/building_campaigns/delivery_types/api_triggered_delivery/) or [Canvas]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/create_a_canvas/?tab=api-triggered%20delivery#step-2b-determine-your-canvas-entry-schedule) in Braze. OfferFit will use this campaign or Canvas to send 1:1 personalized activation events to the right users from your defined audience. 
2. Do not include a Braze [control group]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/testing/multivariant_testing/create_multivariate_campaign#including-a-control-group) in your campaign or Canvas. This allows the OfferFit control group to be the only active one.
3. Depending on your dimensions, you can configure Liquid tags in your creative content to dynamically populate your campaign or Canvas with OfferFit recommendations. OfferFit will pass customer-specific content to the Liquid tags in your templates via the Braze API.

### Step 4: Orchestrate activation events

You can leverage the OfferFit native activation integration with Braze to orchestrate and schedule 1:1 personalized recommendations for your target audience.
