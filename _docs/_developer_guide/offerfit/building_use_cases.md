# Building use cases

> Learn how to build an OfferFit use case, so you can automate personalized experimentation and optimize outcomes like conversions, retention, or revenue&#8212;without manual A/B testing.

## About use cases

A use case is a custom configuration for OfferFitâ€™s AI decisioning engine that's tailor-made to meet a specific business goal.

For example, you could build a repeat purchase use case to increase follow-up conversions after an initial sale. You define the audience and message in Braze, while OfferFit runs daily experiments and automatically tests different combinations of product offers, message timing, and frequency for each customer. Over time, OfferFit learns what works best and orchestrates personalized sends through Braze to maximize repurchase rates.

To build a good use case, you'll:

- Choose a success metric for OfferFit to optimize for, such as revenue, conversions, or ARPU.
- Define which dimensions to test, such as offer, subject line, creative, channel, or send time.
- Select the options for each dimension, such as email vs. SMS or daily vs. weekly frequency.

## Sample use cases

OfferFit's AI decisioning agents will learn from every customer interaction and apply those insights to the next day's actions.

## Building a use case

### Prerequisites

Before you can build a use case, you'll need to [integrate OfferFit by Braze]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/offerfit/integration).

### Step 1: Contact OfferFit

OfferFit's AI Expert Services team will work closely with you to scope, design, and build your OfferFit use case. If you haven't already, [reach out](https://offerfit.ai/book-now) to get started.

You'll complete the following steps together to build a custom use case that's right for you.

### Step 2: Design your use case

Alongside OfferFit's AI Expert Services team, you'll define:

- a target audience, 
- the business metric to optimize, 
- the actions for OfferFit's AI decisioning agent, and 
- any first-party customer data the agent should leverage to drive your business outcomes. 

With the design in hand, the team will work with you to identify and complete any additional integration requirements.

### Step 3: Set up your delivery platform

Next, the AI Expert Service team will help you set up your marketing automation platform. While OfferFit works best with Braze, a variety of other platforms are supported&#8212;contact your AI Expert Service team for additional resources.

To set up Braze:

1. Create a [campaign]({{site.baseurl}}//user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/building_campaigns/delivery_types/api_triggered_delivery/) or [Canvas]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/create_a_canvas/?tab=api-triggered%20delivery#step-2b-determine-your-canvas-entry-schedule). OfferFit will use this delivery method to send 1:1 personalized activation events to the users in your defined audience.
2. Be sure you don't include a Braze [control group]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/testing/multivariant_testing/create_multivariate_campaign#including-a-control-group), so OfferFit can be the dedicated control group instead.
3. Depending on your dimensions, you can configure Liquid tags in your creative content to dynamically populate your messaging with OfferFit recommendations. OfferFit will pass customer-specific content to the Liquid tags in your templates using the Braze API.

### Step 4: Launch and monitor

After launching your use case, your AI Expert Services team will continue to monitor and tune it to your agreed-upon design. They'll also help you make any adjustments, expansions, or modifications to the use case, if needed.
