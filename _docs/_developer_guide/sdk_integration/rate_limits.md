# Braze SDK rate limits

> Learn about the Braze SDK's intelligent, client-side rate limiting that optimizes battery life, reduces bandwidth usage, and ensures reliable data delivery.

## Understanding SDK rate limits

Braze SDK rate limiting uses the following features to optimize performance, minimize battery drain, reduce data usage, and ensure reliable data delivery:

### Asynchronous processing

The Braze SDK uses a token bucket algorithm for rate limiting. This approach allows for bursts of activity while maintaining long-term rate control. Instead of processing requests in a strict queue, the token bucket operates asynchronously:

- **Token generation**: Tokens are replenished at a steady rate into the bucket.
- **Request handling**: Any SDK call that arrives when a token is available proceeds immediately, regardless of when other calls arrived.
- **No strict ordering**: Requests don’t wait in line; multiple calls may compete for the next available token.
- **Burst handling**: Short bursts of activity are allowed if enough tokens are available at the time of the requests.
- **Rate control**: Long-term throughput is limited by the steady token replenishment rate.

This asynchronous flow helps the SDK respond quickly to available network capacity while maintaining predictable overall traffic levels.

### Adaptive rate limiting

The Braze SDK can adjust rate limits in real time to protect network infrastructure and maintain optimal performance. This approach:

- **Prevents overload**: Adjusts limits to avoid network congestion.
- **Optimizes performance**: Maintains smooth SDK operation under varying conditions.
- **Responds to conditions**: Adapts based on current network and usage patterns.

Because limits adapt in real time, exact bucket sizes and static values are not provided. They may change depending on network conditions and usage.

### Networking optimizations

The Braze SDK includes several built-in behaviors to improve efficiency, reduce battery usage, and handle varying network conditions:

- **Automatic batching**: Queues events and sends them in efficient batches.
- **Network-aware behavior**: Adjusts flush rates based on connectivity quality.
- **Battery optimization**: Minimizes radio wake-ups and network calls.
- **Graceful degradation**: Maintains functionality during poor network conditions.
- **Background/foreground awareness**: Optimizes behavior as the app’s lifecycle changes.

## Best practices

Follow these best practices to help avoid rate limit issues:

| Do this | Not this |
| --- | --- |
| Track meaningful user actions and milestones | Track every minor interaction or UI event |
| Refresh content only when necessary | Refresh content on every user action (like scroll events) |
| Let the SDK handle batching automatically | Force immediate data transmission (unless absolutely necessary) |
| Focus on events that add value to analytics | Call SDK methods in rapid succession without considering frequency |

## Getting help

If you're experiencing SDK rate limit issues, review the following networking methods:

- `requestImmediateDataFlush()`
- `requestContentCardsRefresh()`
- `refreshFeatureFlags()`
- `logCustomEvent()`
- `logPurchase()`
