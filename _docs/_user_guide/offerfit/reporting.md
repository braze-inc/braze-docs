## Changing report dates

After [opening a report](#view), you can change the date range by selecting a new start and end date from the calendar dropdown.

### Performance

The performance report offers high-level use case metrics that compare treatment groups (from Braze) to one or more control groups, (like revenue). It supports two different views: **Trending** and **Driver Tree**.

By default, the report uses the **Trending** view, which compares how OfferFit performs over time compared to your control groups, and tracks the uplift evolution.

![Performance report trending view showing a line chart comparing OfferFit and control group performance over time. The chart displays two lines labeled OfferFit and Control, with the y-axis labeled Uplift and the x-axis showing dates. A legend identifies each group by color.]({% image_buster /assets/img/decisioning_studio/reporting_agent_performance_trending.png %})

Alternatively, you can select **Driver Tree** to view how key value drivers are linked to target metrics, helping you better understand the relationship between them.

![Performance report driver tree view showing a hierarchical diagram that maps key value drivers to target metrics. The diagram displays several connected nodes, each labeled with a driver or metric name, illustrating how different factors contribute to overall performance.]({% image_buster /assets/img/decisioning_studio/reporting_performance_drivertree.png %})

To compare performance between two groups, use the dropdowns to select your desired comparison criteria. Refer to the following table for more details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Comparison groups | The groups that you want to compare in your report. |
| Aggregation | The way the report groups data, such as totals, averages, or percentages. |

{% tabs local %}
{% tab agent preferences %}
The **Agent preferences** report helps you identify seasonal trends and assess the relevance of the choices in the action bank, guiding informed decisions for updates.

![Agent preferences report showing a bar chart comparing how often different recommendation options were selected over a specific time period. The chart displays several colored bars, each representing a recommendation option from the action bank, with the y-axis labeled as percent of time chosen and the x-axis listing option names.]({% image_buster /assets/img/decisioning_studio/reporting_insights_agent_preferences.png %})

{% endtab %}

{% tab shaps %}
The **SHAPs** report uses the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model to help you quantify how each feature or variable contributes to your recommendation model. Each point on the chart represents one SHAP and the distribution of the points represent a general sense of a feature's directional impact.

![SHAPs report chart displaying a horizontal bar graph with multiple colored bars representing different features or variables. Each bar shows the impact of a feature on the recommendation model, with the x-axis labeled SHAP value and the y-axis listing feature names such as Recency, Frequency, and Channel. The chart visualizes how each feature contributes positively or negatively to the model's predictions.]({% image_buster /assets/img/decisioning_studio/reporting_insights_shaps.png %})

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Diagnostics

The diagnostics report contains two different report types: **Outbound** and **Inbound**.

{% tabs local %}
{% tab outbound %}
The outbound diagnostics report shows the daily volume of recommendations generated and activated across your audiences. Use it to spot delivery issues, track spikes or drops in activations, and confirm that messages are reaching the right groups as expected.

![Outbound diagnostics report showing a line chart tracking the daily volume of recommendations generated and activated for different audience groups. The chart displays two lines labeled Generated and Activated, with the y-axis representing the number of recommendations and the x-axis showing dates. A legend identifies each line by color.

{% endtab %}

{% tab inbound %}

The inbound diagnostics report monitors the health of your data feeds into OfferFit. It tracks details like file counts, sizes, and row volumes for each asset, helping you confirm that data is flowing in as expected and troubleshoot issues before they affect your models or campaigns.

You can use the dropdown to select different chart metrics, like average file size or file count.

![Inbound diagnostics report showing a line chart tracking the daily file count and average file size for data assets delivered to OfferFit.
