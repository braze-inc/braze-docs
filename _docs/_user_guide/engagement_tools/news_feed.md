guide_top_text: "Push messages, emails, and in-app messages are wonderful but ephemeral content. Once swiped away, you lose your opportunity to engage. If you catch a user at the wrong time, that message is lost to them forever. Multichannel messaging helps to ameliorate this problem, but the News Feed really puts it to rest once and for all."
