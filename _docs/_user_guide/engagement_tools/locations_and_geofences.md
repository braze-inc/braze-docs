## About locations and geofences

With Braze, you can create and enhance relationships with your users based upon their location in the real world, unlocking a powerful set of deeply connected interactions:

- Upload the locations of all of your brands' brick and mortar stores, and send push notifications to loyal users notifying them of in-store promotions if they pass nearby. 
- Upload the location of an upcoming concert, and message users letting them know where to register when they reach the venue. Then, follow up with a thank you message an hour after they depart.

You can gather and utilize user location data in a couple of ways:

- When a user opens your app, location tracking captures their most recent locations using GPS location data. This allows you to see where your users have been and segment based on this data.
- Geofences are defined virtual geographic areas. If a user has enabled background location tracking, you can use geofences to trigger campaigns in real-time when a user is in a geofence. Geofences are only available in select Braze packages. For access, please reach out to your Braze representative.
