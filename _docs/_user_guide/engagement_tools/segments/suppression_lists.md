# Suppression lists

> Suppression lists specify groups of users who will never receive messages. Admins can create dynamic suppression lists with segment filters to narrow down a user group the same way you would for segmentation.

{% alert important %}
Suppression lists are currently in beta. If you're interested in being part of this beta, reach out to your customer success manager. During the beta, functionality may change, and you can have up to five active suppression lists at a time, but let your customer success manager know if you need more. 
{% endalert %}

## How it works

Suppression lists are dynamic and automatically apply to certain forms of messaging, but you can set exceptions for selected tags. If your selected exception tags are used in a campaign or Canvas, then that suppression list won't apply to that campaign or Canvas. Messages from campaigns or Canvases with exception tags will still reach any suppression list users that are part of your target segments.

### Messages not affected by suppression lists

As part of the beta, suppression lists will not apply to the following message types (in other words, suppression list users **will still** receive messages that belong to the following):
- Feature Flags
- Transactional use cases
- API campaigns
- API-triggered campaigns
- API-triggered Canvases
- Campaigns triggered by the Braze API (`/messages` and `/send`)

You don't need to add an exception tag for any of these use cases, as suppression lists automatically won't apply to them. To exclude a group of users from a message within these use cases, you need to create a target segment that excludes these users.

{% alert important %}
During the beta, we collect customer feedback to help improve our product. Tell your customer success manager if you plan to apply suppression lists to transactional use cases.
{% endalert %}

### Channels affected by suppression lists

Suppression lists are dynamic and will automatically apply to all of the following channels (unless the campaign or Canvas contains an exception tag): 
- SMS
- Email
- Push
- In-app messages
- Content Card
- Banner
- SMS/MMS
- Webhook
- WhatsApp
- LINE

## Setting up suppression lists

Because suppression lists can significantly impact the messages you send, only admins can edit, save, active, and deactivate suppression lists (all users can view suppression lists).

1. Go to **Audience** > **Suppression Lists**.<br><br>![The "Suppression Lists" page with a list of three suppression lists.][1]<br><br>
2. Select **Create Suppression List** and add a name.<br><br>![A window called "Create a Suppression List" with a field to enter a name.][2]{: style="max-width:80%;"}<br><br>
3. Use segment filters to identify the users in your suppression lists. You must select at least one.

{% alert important %}
Though the setup process seems similar to [segment creation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/creating_a_segment/), a suppression list is a group of users that you **do not** want to send messages to regardless of segment membership.

4. Determine whether to have exceptions based on tag by checking the box beneath your segment name (refer to [How it works](#how-it-works) for more information), then add the tags of campaigns or Canvases that users in this suppression list should still receive. <br><br>In other words, if you add the exception tag “Shipping confirmation”, users in your suppression list will be excluded from all messaging except those that use the tag “Shipping confirmation".<br><br>![The "Shipping List Details" section with an exception tag applied called "Shipping confirmation".][4]<br><br>
5. Save or activate your suppression list.
- When you save, your suppression list will be saved but won't be activated, which means it won't go into effect. Your suppression list will remain inactive until you activate it, and inactive suppression lists won't impact messaging (users won't excluded from messages).
- When you activate, your suppression list will be saved and immediately go into effect, which means users in your suppression list will immediately be excluded from campaigns or Canvases (except for ones containing an exception tag).

{% alert note %}
Only admins can save or activate suppression lists. You can have up to five active suppression lists at a time in the beta.
{% endalert %}

You can deactivate or archive suppression lists when you no longer need them. 
- To deactivate, select an active suppression list and select **Deactivate**. Deactivated suppression lists can be reactivated later.
- To archive, do so from the **Suppression Lists** page.

## Suppression list usage

### For campaigns

![The "Suppression Lists" section with one active suppression list, called "Low marketing health scores".][5]

If a user is in a suppression list, they won't receive a campaign for which that suppression list applies. Refer to [Messages not affected by suppression lists](#messages-not-affected-by-suppression-lists) for cases when a suppression list won't apply.

#### Checking which suppression lists are applied

To check for suppression list usage within a campaign, go to the **Suppression List** section on the **Target Audience** page to view which suppression lists are being applied to that campaign.

### For Canvases

If a user is in a suppression list, they will still enter the Canvas but won't be able to receive Message steps within the Canvas. When they advance to a Message step, they will be exited from the Canvas. However, a user in a suppression list is still able to receive non-Message steps prior to a Message step. 

#### Preventing segments from entering a Canvas

For a segment to not be entered into a Canvas **at all**, you can configure that Canvas' Target settings to exclude that segment by following these steps:

1. Build a segment using the same filters and criteria as your supression list.
2. In the **Target** step, use the **Segment Membership** filter to target users who aren't included in your segment.

For example, let’s say you have a Canvas with an applied suppression list. The Canvas has a User Update step followed by a Message step. In this scenario, suppression list users will enter the Canvas, proceed through the User Update step (where the user may be updated, based on how that step is configured), and then exit at the Message step (at which point the user will be included in the “Exited” metrics). 

#### Checking which suppression lists are applied

To check for suppression list usage within a Canvas, go to the **Suppression List** section on the **Target Audience** page to view which suppression lists are being applied to that Canvas. You can also view applied suppression lists in the **Summary** step.
