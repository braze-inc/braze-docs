# Location targeting

> This article will walk you through how to set up Location Targeting, allowing you to segment users by their most recent location. This is perfect for if you are looking into location-based campaigns and strategies.

## Step 1: Create your segment

Navigate to the **Segments** page, under **Audience**, to view all of your current user segments. On this page, you can create and name new segments. To get started, select **Create Segment** and give your segment a name.

## Step 2: Customize your location

After you have created your segment, add a **Most Recent Location** filter to target users by the last place that they used your app. You have the option of  highlighting users within or outside of a standard circular region or customizable polygonal region.

![Filter for a most recent location within a circle.]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/filter_recent_location.png %})

### Circular regions

For circular regions, you can move the origin and adjust the location radius for your segmentation.

### Polygonal regions

For polygonal regions, you can more specifically designate which areas you wish to be included in your segment.

## Partnership support for beacon and geofence

Combining existing beacon or geofence support with our targeting and messaging features gives you more information about your users' physical actions so you can message them accordingly. You can leverage location tracking with some of our partners:
