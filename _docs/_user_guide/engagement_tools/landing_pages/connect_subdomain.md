# Connecting a subdomain

> If you own a domain through a third-party service, you can connect its subdomains to your Braze account. You can then use subdomains with your Braze-hosted landing pages to brand and customize your URLs. 

{% alert note %}
Landing pages are currently in beta. Contact your Braze account manager if you’re interested in participating in this beta.
{% endalert %}

To connect a subdomain to your Braze account, have an administrator follow the steps below.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Landing Page Settings**.
2. Enter the subdomain you want to connect and select **Submit**.
3. Copy and paste the **TXT** and **CNAME** records into the relevant settings of your domain provider account.
4. Return to the Braze dashboard to verify the connection.

{% alert note %}
Depending on your domain provider, the subdomain connection can take up to 48 hours. When the process is complete, we’ll update your **Landing Page Settings** page.
{% endalert %}

## Using your subdomain

After your subdomain verification is complete, you can use your subdomain for your Braze-hosted landing pages by default. For example, if you connect the subdomain `promo.example.com`, you can add a URL to your landing page that looks like `promo.example.com/holiday-sale`.

{% alert note %}
Contact your customer success manager if you need to remove your subdomain.
{% endalert %}

## Troubleshooting 

### My subdomain connection failed

Verify that your subdomain was entered correctly and that it matches what you submitted to Braze from your domain provider account. If it's correct and matches, check the TXT and CNAME records provided by Braze. They should match the records you entered into your domain provider account.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can I connect multiple subdomains to my workspace or connect one subdomain to multiple workspaces?

No, you currently can only connect one subdomain to a workspace.
