  Campaigns and Canvases share similar concepts and terms for message composition, but can vary in how the workflow is set up in the respective builder in the dashboard. These shared fundamentals can be understood in how you:

  * Determine when users should enter your message.
  * Target specific users by segment.
  * Assign conversion events.
  * Build the content of your message.

  By understanding these shared terms and how they're applicable, you can strategically build your messages regardless of which messaging method you choose.
