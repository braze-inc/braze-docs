# Locales in messages

> After adding locales to your workspace, you can target users in different languages all within a single push, email, or in-app message.

{% multi_lang_include locales.md section="Prerequisites" %}

{% alert important %}
Multi-language support and locales in messages are currently in early access. Contact your Braze account manager if youâ€™re interested in participating in this early access.
{% endalert %}

## Using locales

{% tabs %}
{% tab In-app message %}

To use locales in your messaging, compose an in-app message campaign or Canvas. Select either the drag-and-drop editor or the traditional editor, then follow the steps based on your editor.

{% subtabs %}
{% subtab traditional editor %}

1. Add translation tags {% raw %}`{% translation %}` and `{% endtranslation %}`{% endraw %} to wrap all text and image or link URLs to be translated. 
2. Add an ID tag to each translation tag. An example is: {% raw %}`{% translation id_1 %}`{% endraw %}

![Traditional editor with translation IDs.]({% image_buster /assets/img/multi-language_support/html_iam_editor_translation_tags.png %}){: style="max-width:60%;"}

{: start="3"}
3. After adding the tags, save your message as a draft.
4. Select **Manage languages** and add your locales for the message using the dropdown.

!["Manage languages" modal with one selected locale.]({% image_buster /assets/img/multi-language_support/manage_languages_modal.png %})

{: start="5"}
5. Select **Download template** to download the translation template as a CSV file. Then, fill in the translations in the CSV file.

6. Fill in the translations in the CSV file. If you've copied and pasted the translation tags directly from Step 1, you may need to remove `<code>` from the **Translation tags** column of the CSV file.
7. Select **Upload translations** to upload the CSV file with the completed translations.

Any changes to the IDs or locales in the CSV file will not automatically update in your message. To update the translations, update the CSV file and re-upload the file.

{% alert tip %}
Check out our [Translation API]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/translations) to manage and update translations in your campaigns and Canvases.

## Managing translations

### Editing translations for launched campaigns and Canvases

After a campaign or Canvas has been launched, you can still modify translations when you're in draft mode. This applies whether you're editing translations directly in the composer, by CSV upload, or through the API. 

Before making any translation updates, the campaign or Canvas must first be saved as a draft.

1. Select **Edit campaign/Canvas** and then make your edits in the composer.
2. Select **Save as draft**, and then select **Yes** in the modal.
3. Go to the **Review Summary** step and select **Update campaign/Canvas**.
4. Select **Update campaign/Canvas** in the modal.

For more details on managing campaigns and Canvases after launch, refer to [Editing launched campaigns]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/managing_campaigns/change_your_campaign_after_launch/) and [Canvas drafts and post-launch editing]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/managing_canvases/canvas_drafts/).

### Duplicating Canvas steps or campaigns, and translations

When duplicating a Canvas step or a campaign, whether in the draft mode after launch or during initial creation, the translations associated with that step won't be carried over. Any necessary translations need to be added to the new step or campaign. Be sure to review and update translations accordingly when making modifications to your Canvas or campaign.

### Using the multi-language API with Canvases

To use the [multi-language API with Canvases]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/translations/), you must include the `workflow_id`, `step_id`, and `message_variation_id` in the parameter list.

#### Canvas steps added to post-launch drafts

When using the multi-language API with Canvas steps that were created after the Canvas has been launched, the `message_variation_id` that you pass into the API will be empty or blank.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Can I make a change to the translated copy in one of my locales?
Yes. First, make the edit in the CSV, then upload the file again to make a change to the translated copy.

#### Can I nest translation tags?
No.

#### Can I add HTML styling in the translation tags?
Yes, but be sure to check that the HTML styling is not translated with the content.
