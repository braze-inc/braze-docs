# Archiving campaigns and Canvases

> Archiving your campaigns and Canvases can be a simple and effective way of organizing your workspace. As you continue building more messages, archiving can help make sure your focus is on active and relevant messaging efforts.

## Archiving

When you archive a campaign or Canvas, no more messages will be delivered and your in-app messages won't be displayed. You can still view results after it's archived, but you won't be able to edit the campaign or Canvas. To do so, you'll need to [unarchive it](#unarchiving-campaigns-and-canvases) first.

{% tabs local %}
{% tab campaign %}
To archive a campaign:

1. Go to **Messaging** > **Campaigns**.
2. Hover over the campaign's row and select the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> menu.
3. Select **Archive**.
{% endtab %}

{% tab canvas %}
To archive a Canvas:

1. Go to **Messaging** > **Canvas**.
2. Hover over the row of the Canvas and select the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> menu.
3. Select **Archive**.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Unarchiving

When you unarchive a campaign or Canvas, it won't go live&mdash;its status will only be changed to **Active**. After unarchiving, you can edit and review how the message is set up without any messages being sent.

To resume the campaign or Canvas and begin sending messages, select the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> menu for the respective row and select **Resume**.
