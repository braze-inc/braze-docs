# Archiving campaigns and Canvases

> Archiving your campaigns and Canvases can be a simple and effective way of organizing your workspace. As you continue building more messages, archiving can help make sure your focus is on active and relevant messaging efforts.
## How it works

When you archive a campaign or Canvas, no further messages will be delivered. In the case of in-app messages, no further in-app messages from that campaign will be displayed to users.

After a campaign or Canvas has been archived, you can still view its results, but you won't be able to edit the campaign or Canvas. To edit an archived campaign or Canvas, you'll have to [unarchive it](#unarchiving-campaigns-and-canvases) first.

### For campaigns

To archive a campaign, do the following:

1. Go to **Messaging** > **Campaigns**.
2. Hover over the campaign's row and select the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> menu.
3. Select **Archive**.

### For Canvas

To archive a Canvas, do the following:

1. Go to **Messaging** > **Canvas**.
2. Hover over the row of the Canvas and select the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> menu.
3. Select **Archive**.

## Unarchiving campaigns and Canvases

Unarchiving a campaign or Canvas doesn't make it live. This just updates your campaign status to **Active**. At this point, you can edit and review how the message is set up. Your campaign and Canvas will be stopped and won't send any messages.

If you want to resume the campaign or Canvas and begin sending messages, select the g<i class="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> menu for the respective row and select **Resume**.
