# Duplicating campaigns and Canvases

> You can duplicate pre-existing campaigns and Canvases to continually iterate and build off your successful strategies. Duplicating campaigns and Canvases helps minimize the time you would spend reconfiguring delivery details and audience segments.

## Duplicating

After you duplicate a campaign or Canvas, the new message will be automatically titled `"Copy of [Original Name]"` and you'll be brought to its editing page. These duplicates will remain as drafts until you edit and launch them.

{% alert tip %}
You can also [copy your campaign]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/messaging_fundamentals/copying_across_workspaces/) across workspaces. The copy will remain as a draft until you edit and launch.
{% endalert %}

{% tab campaign %}

2. Hover over the campaign and select <i class="fas fa-gear"></i> **More actions**.
