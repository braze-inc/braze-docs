# Duplicating campaigns and Canvases

> You can duplicate pre-existing campaigns and Canvases to continually iterate and build off your successful strategies. Duplicating campaigns and Canvases helps minimize the time you would spend reconfiguring delivery details and audience segments.

## Duplicating

After you duplicate a campaign or Canvas, the new message will be automatically titled `"Copy of [Original Name]"` and you'll be brought to its editing page. These duplicates will remain as drafts until you edit and launch them.

{% tabs %}
{% tab campaign %}
To duplicate a campaign:

1. Go to **Messaging** > **Campaigns**.
2. Hover over the campaign and select <i class="fas fa-gear"></i> **More actions**.
3. Select **Duplicate**. 
{% endtab %}

{% tab canvas %}
To duplicate a Canvas:

1. Go to **Messaging** > **Canvas**.
2. Hover over the Canvas row and select <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> **More actions**.
3. Select **Duplicate**.

{% details Original Canvas editor %}

As of February 28, 2023, you can no longer create or duplicate Canvases using the original Canvas experience. 

Braze recommends that customers who use the original Canvas experience move to Canvas Flow. It's an improved editing experience to better build and manage Canvases. Learn more about [cloning your Canvases to Canvas Flow]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/managing_canvases/cloning_canvases/).
