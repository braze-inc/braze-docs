# Messaging rules

> Use messaging rules to set user volume thresholds for campaigns and Canvases that will require additional approval before launch&#8212;this way, you can have another review when a larger audience is targeted in your messaging.

## How it works

Messaging rules apply to a workspace and are made up of a message type and a maximum reachable user threshold.

- **Message type:** Defines what message type the rule will be applied to: campaign, Canvas, or both Canvas and campaigns.
- **Maximum reachable users:** Determines what audience size that will require an additional approval.

Only Braze administrators can set messaging rules, but any Braze user can be a messaging rule approver (including users without general approval permissions).

When setting up your messaging rule, two rules can exist with the same number of reachable users for the same message type. For example, you can set a maximum of 10,000 users for Canvas and 10,000 users for both Canvas and campaigns. 

Similarly, you can save two rules that share the same user maximum so that you can organize and separate your rules by approvers. For example, you create the following two rules:

- Rule A for Canvas with a maximum of 100,000 users with approvers on your legal team
- Rule B for Canvas with a maximum of 100,000 users with approvers on your marketing team 

However, you canâ€™t set rules with overlapping user volumes for the same message type. For example, the following messaging rule **can't** be set: 

- Rule C for Canvas with a maximum of 10,000 users 
- Rule D for Canvas with a maximum of 1,000,000 users

## Creating a messaging rule

### Step 1: Add a rule

{% alert note %}
You can create up to five messaging rules.
{% endalert %}

1. Go to **Settings** > **Approval Workflow** > **Messaging Rules**.
2. Select **Create rule**.
3. Give this rule a name (for example, "All user subscriptions").
4. For **Message type**, select **Campaign**, **Canvas**, or **Both Canvas and Campaigns** to apply the approval rule.
5. Enter a number for **Maximum reachable users**. For more information, refer to [Audience statistics]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/building_campaigns/targeting_users#audience-statistics).
6. Select **Save**.

### Step 2: Determine launching with approval (optional)

1. Select **Allow launching with approval**.
2. For **With Approval From**, select the approvers who have permission to approve the Canvas or campaign if the maximum is met.

Note the following details on launching messages with approval:

- If the maximum is met and an approver is selected, the Braze user with the approval permission will be able to select **Approved** from the **Target Audience** approval dropdown.
- If the maximum is met an an approve is not selected, the Canvas or campaign will be prevented from launching.

## Frequently asked questions

### Do I have to reconfigure my permissions to use messaging rules?

No. Any user, regardless of their current permissions, can be selected as a target population approver.

### How do messaging rules relate to the Target Audience step?

Messaging rules don't take into account details such as triggering events. For example, a campaign might target all your users. However, the campaign is event triggered, so the actual users who receive it is lower.

### Will anything automatically change when messaging rules are turned on?

No. After this feature is turned on, you must manually enter the maximum number of users and select approvers to use the feature.
