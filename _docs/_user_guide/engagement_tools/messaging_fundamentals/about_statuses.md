# Understanding messaging statuses

> On your Braze dashboard, your campaigns and Canvases are grouped by their status. Learn about the different statuses and descriptions for what they mean and how you can organize your messages.

## Message statuses

As you build and send campaigns and Canvases, these messages will have their status displayed by default. You can update the status of the message by selecting the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> menu in the row.

Refer to the following table for statuses and their descriptions.

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Active | Active campaigns and Canvases are in the process of sending. By default, you'll see active campaigns and Canvases on the respective pages. |
| Draft | Drafts of campaigns and Canvases are saved but not launched. To continue editing and begin sending, you can select the draft by going to **Messaging** in the Braze dashboard and selecting **Canvas** or **Campaigns**. |
| Archived | Archived campaigns and Canvases are messages that are no longer being sent. These campaigns and Canvases are also removed from the statistic graphs on the [**Home**]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/dashboard/home_dashboard) and [**Revenue**]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/reporting/revenue_report) pages.|
| Stopped | Stopped campaigns and Canvases are paused, but you can still edit them. To resume a stopped campaign or Canvas, select the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> menu then **Resume**. |
| Idle | When a campaign or Canvas is no longer sending messages, Braze will assign it an idle status to help sort and manage your list of campaigns and Canvases. You can view which campaigns or Canvases will be automatically stopped and the associated stop date. |

## Best practices

### Monitor your messages by status

You can monitor your messages by status to review the performance details. For example, if you have a series of active campaigns, you can evaluate the performance of each campaign with their engagement metrics and make adjustments as needed. If instead you have a few stopped Canvases, you can consider whether they should be resumed for messaging or archived entirely.

Looking for more ways to stay organized? Add [teams]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_your_braze_users/teams) and [tags]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/tags) to provide more context at-a-glance.
{% endalert %}

### Audit your active messages

By performing audits of your active campaigns and Canvases, you can assess the relevance and performance, and remove or update any outdated campaigns and Canvases to keep your messaging fresh.
