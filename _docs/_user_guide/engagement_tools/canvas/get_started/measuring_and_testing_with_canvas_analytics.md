# Measuring and testing with canvas analytics

You need to know if what you’re building is moving the needle. Canvas makes it easy to understand how the experiences you’re building are impacting your goals. Once you build your Canvas and set it live, you can review performance on the Canvas Details page.

## Canvas overview
<br>
![Canvas Analytics Overview][24]

At the top of the Canvas Details page, there are topline Canvas stats. These include the number of messages sent within the Canvas, the total number of times customers have entered the Canvas, how many have converted and your total rate, the revenue generated by the Canvas, and the estimated total audience. This is a great way to level set in general how you’re doing against your goal.

## Performance visualization

![Step Details][25]

As you move down the Canvas details page, you’ll see the performance for each step. These metrics include sends, unique recipients, conversion count, and revenue generated. You can click to breakdown further and see channel specific performance.

## Performance breakdown by variant

![Journey_7][26]

At the bottom of the Canvas Details page, click `Analyze Variants`, where you can see a breakdown (by variant and Control Group if you have more than one) of performance. You can also copy the Canvas API Identifier, download a `.csv` of the metrics, and copy the cells. 

You will then see a table which shows you a breakdown of each variant at several levels:

Basic Metrics:  
- Variant API Identifier
- Total Entries
- Total Sends
- Total Steps
- Total Revenue

Beyond that, you'll see a more explicit breakdown of Conversion Events:
- conversion totals and conversion rates for each conversion event,
- uplift against the control variant,
- statistical confidence for each conversion event.

You can quickly infer effective variants and identify the right cadences, content, triggers, timing, and more!

## Retention report

User retention is one of the most important metrics for any marketer. Keeping engaged users coming back for more indicates that business is healthy. Braze now allows you to measure user retention right on the Canvas Analytics page. For more information on how to read and interpret your retention report, visit our Canvas [Retention Report][1] page.

## Funnel report

Funnel Reporting offers a visual report that allows you to analyze the journeys your customers take after receiving a campaign or Canvas. If your campaign or Canvas uses a control group or multiple variants, you will be able to understand how the different variants have impacted the conversion funnel at a more granular level and optimize based on this data. For more information on funnel reports, visit our Canvas [Funnel Report][2] page.
