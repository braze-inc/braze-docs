# Moving the Needle: Measuring and Testing with Canvas Analytics

You need to know if what you’re building is moving the needle. Canvas makes it easy to understand how the experiences you’re building are impacting your goals. Once you build your Canvas and set it live, you can review performance on the Canvas Details page.

## Canvas Overview

![Journey_5][24]

At the top of the Canvas Details page, there are topline Canvas stats. These include the number of messages sent within the Canvas, the total number of times customers have entered the Canvas, how many have converted and your total rate, the revenue generated by the Canvas, and the estimated total audience. This is a great way to level set in general how you’re doing against your goal.

## Performance Visualization

![Journey_6][25]

As you move down the Canvas details page, you’ll see the performance for each step. These metrics include sends, unique recipients, conversion count, and revenue generated. You can click to breakdown further and see channel specific performance.

## Performance Breakdown by Variant

![Journey_7][26]

At the bottom of the Canvas Details page, click `Analyze Variants`, where you can see a breakdown (by variant and Control Group if you have more than one) of performance. You can also copy the Canvas API Identifier, download a `.csv` of the metrics, and copy the cells. 

You will then see a table which shows you a breakdown of each variant at several levels:

Basic Metrics:  
- Variant API Identifier,
- Total Entries,
- Total Sends,
- Total Steps,
- Total Revenue.

Beyond that, you'll see a more explicit breakdown of Conversion Events:
- conversion totals and conversion rates for each conversion event,
- uplift against the control variant,
- statistical confidence for each conversion event.

You can quickly infer effective variants and identify the right cadences, content, triggers, timing, and more!
