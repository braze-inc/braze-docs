# Understanding Canvas status

> On your Braze dashboard, your Canvases are grouped by their status. Check out the different Canvas statuses and descriptions for what they mean.

## Draft

Canvases marked as drafts are saved but not launched Canvases. To continue editing and begin sending the Canvas, select the draft.

## Active

Active Canvases are in the process of sending.

## Stopped

Stopped Canvases have been paused, but are still editable. To resume a stopped Canvas, select the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> gear icon for a given Canvas then **Resume**.

## Archived

Archived Canvases are no longer sent and are cleared from the **All Active** tab on the Braze dashboard. These Canvases are also removed from the detailed statistics graphs on the **Overview** and **Revenue** pages.

To archive a Canvas, select the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> gear icon for a given Canvas then **Archive Selected**.

## Idle

When a Canvas is no longer sending messages, Braze will assign an [idle status]({{site.baseurl}}/idle_campaigns_canvases/) to these Canvases to help sort and manage your list of Canvases. With this filter, you can view which Canvases will be automatically stopped and the associated stop date.
