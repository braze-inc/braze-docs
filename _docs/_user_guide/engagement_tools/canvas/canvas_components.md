## About Canvas components

With Canvas components, you can unlock new user journeys to improve your process and increase the effectiveness of your audience outreach.

{% alert important %}
As of February 28, 2023, you will no longer be able to create or duplicate Canvases using the original Canvas experience. Braze recommends that customers who use the original Canvas experience move to Canvas Flow. It's an improved editing experience to better build and manage Canvases. Learn more about [cloning your Canvases to Canvas Flow]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/managing_canvases/cloning_canvases/).
{% endalert %}

### Customizing user journeys

Use [Action Paths][1] to split your user journey based on actions and engagement events such as making a purchase. If you want to filter through and target your audiences, [Audience Paths][2] help simplify your user targeting by sending your users down different Canvas paths based on audience criteria.

[Decision Split][3] components use a simple "yes or no" logic to create two mutually exclusive paths for your user journeys that are based on an action or a user attribute. This can help identify and target your user groups.

[Delay][4] components allow you to delay a single step in your Canvas. This stand-alone delay step in your Canvas is best used for communicating messages to your users at a specific time. Additionally, Delay components may also increase your audience outreach by allowing more time for your audience to meet the component's criteria. 

### Testing
When creating your user journeys, you may want to also test for the most effective Canvas path. With [Experiment Paths][5], you can test multiple Canvas paths at any step. 

### Integration 
Want to sync up with your brand's first-party user data? Leverage the available audience sync options for [Facebook][6] and [Google][7]. <br><br>
