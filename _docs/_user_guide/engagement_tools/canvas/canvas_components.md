## About Canvas components

With Canvas components, you can unlock new user journeys to improve your process and increase the effectiveness of your audience outreach.

### Customizing user journeys

![Example of a Canvas user journey with a Decision Split step followed by Delay steps and Message steps.]({% image_buster /assets/img/canvas_intro/canvas_intro.gif %}){: style="float:right;max-width:55%;margin-left:15px;"}

Use [Action Paths][1] to split your user journey based on actions and engagement events such as making a purchase. If you want to filter through and target your audiences, [Audience Paths][2] help simplify your user targeting by sending your users down different Canvas paths based on audience criteria.

[Decision Split][3] components use a simple "yes or no" logic to create two mutually exclusive paths for your user journeys that are based on an action or a user attribute. This can help identify and target your user groups.

[Delay][4] components allow you to delay a single step in your Canvas. This stand-alone delay step in your Canvas is best used for communicating messages to your users at a specific time. Additionally, Delay components may also increase your audience outreach by allowing more time for your audience to meet the component's criteria.

### Testing

When creating your user journeys, you may want to also test for the most effective Canvas path. With [Experiment Paths][5], you can test multiple Canvas paths at any step. You can also use the connections between steps as a high-level preview. Orange connections indicate the prior step will immediately advance users to the next step.

### Integration
