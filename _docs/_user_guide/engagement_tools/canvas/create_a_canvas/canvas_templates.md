# Creating a Canvas template

> This reference article covers how to create and manage templates for Canvas. Using templates can refine your messaging by creating a consistent framework that can be easily customized to fit your specific goals across your Canvases.

{% alert tip %}
Save time and streamline your Canvas creation by using [Braze Canvas templates](#available-braze-templates)! Browse our library of pre-built templates to find one that fits your use case and customize it to meet your specific needs.
{% endalert %}

## Method 1: Create from an existing Canvas

### Step 1: Select your existing Canvas

In the Braze dashboard, go to **Messaging** > **Canvas** and select an existing Canvas you want to use as a template.

### Step 2: Create your template

In the Canvas editor, select **Edit Canvas** or **Edit draft**, depending on if your Canvas is active or in a draft. Expand the **Save as draft** dropdown in the footer and select **Save as template**.

### Step 3: Save your template

Next, give your template a name and add any relevant tags. Then, select **Save**. Your template is now ready to use for building a Canvas, giving you a head start with your basic settings and steps already in place.

## Method 2: Create via Canvas template editor

### Step 1: Go to the Canvas template editor

In the Braze dashboard, go to **Templates** > **Canvas Templates**.

{% alert note %}
If you are using the older navigation, you can find this page under **Engagement** > **Templates & Media** > **Canvas Templates**.
{% endalert %}

### Step 2: Create a new template

Select **Create template** and begin setting up your Canvas details. You can start by giving your Canvas template a name.

![An example Canvas template named "Annual sale Canvas template" with the description "Use for annual spring promotion".][1]

### Step 3: Customize your template

Next, customize your template by [setting up your Canvas]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/create_a_canvas/#step-2-set-up-your-canvas). You can decide when users should enter the Canvas, determine which users can enter this Canvas, adjust your send settings, and build your user journey for the template.

### Step 4: Save your template

After you've finished customizing your template, select the **Save template** button. On the **Canvas template** page, you can view your Canvas template details by selecting <i class="fas fa-list"></i> **Template details**. 

## Using Canvas templates

There are two ways to use your template when composing a Canvas:

- **From Messsaging**: Go to **Messaging** > **Canvas**. Select the **Create Canvas** button and **Use a Canvas Template**.
- **From Templates**: Go to **Templates** > **Canvas Templates** and find your desired template. Then, select the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> menu followed by **Apply template**. This will bring you to a new Canvas with the template applied in the Canvas composer.

### Available Braze templates

Braze has a selection of Canvas templates available for you to reference and use as best practices for common use cases. While these templates can't be edited, you can view them in **Templates** > **Braze templates** or use them in your Canvases.

Select from the following available templates to reference or use as your Canvas.

{% tabs %}
{% tab Abandoned Intent %}

Engage with users in real-time to encourage them to complete their purchases.

Consider the following when using this template:

- Add a specific audience. Currently, the audience paths are triggered based on "Made Any Purchase", but you can tailor this to specific products you want to target.
- This template assumes you have a separate post-purchase journey, so making a purchase will cause users to exit the Canvas.
- Fill out the details in the Audience Sync step.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Back In Stock %}

Drive purchases by notifying your users when an item is back in stock with personalized messaging. Consider the following when using this template:

- In **Entry Schedule**, select a catalog to use. This allows you to access data, such as products, discounts, and promotions, to further target your users.
- In **Target Audience**, add a segment to target users who indicated interest in a certain item.
- In the Message steps throughout the Canvas, update the Liquid to reference your catalog.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Feature Adoption %}

Deliver timely personalized messages to highlight the benefits and usage tips. Consider the following when using this template:

- Exclude users who have already used the product. For example, in **Target Audience**, add a filter in 
-  To use the Experiment Path step, define a conversion event. This event should be the event that signals feature adoption.
- Set up the Action Path step in the template with custom events for "Activated Feature" and "Taken Tour".
- Set up the custom attributes in the Message step named "Feedback Survey" to capture sentiment of feedback.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Lapsed User %}

Bring users back to your app with incentives based on their past engagements. Consider the following when using this template:

- In **Basics**, select a specific app to track conversions for.
- In the Canvas editor, add specific apps for the Action Paths steps.
- Configure the Audience Sync step with the partners and audiences for your use case.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Onboarding %}

Create onboarding journeys that promote strong initial adoption and encourage lasting relationships with your users. Consider the following when using this template:

- In the Audience Paths step named "Audience Split", consider customizing the key actions for engaged users. In the template, the segment filter is "Has clicked email for step Welcome Email".

{% endtab %}
{% tab Post-Purchase Feedback %}

Orchestrate personalized experiences that allow you to respond to feedback and build a relationship with your users. Consider the following when using this template:

- In the first step of the Canvas editor:
    - Specify the custom attributes in the in-app message to indicate the sentiment of the feedback based on the selected survey option. 
    - Specify attributes on links for each call-to-action to capture which option is selected. These attributes are referenced in the subsequent audience path.
- Customize the Audience Path with the attributes from the first step of this template.
- Set up the Audience Sync step named "Ad Retargeting".

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Managing Canvas templates

Canvas templates can be duplicated and archived, similar to an actual Canvas. To edit a Canvas template, select the template then **<i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i>Edit**.

At a workspace level, you can update user permissions to allow or limit the access to create, edit, view, or archive Canvas templates.

### Permissions for teams and workspaces

To only allow certain users to access and use specific Canvas templates, [add a team]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_your_braze_users/teams/) to the templates, then assign team-level "Access Campaigns, Canvases, Content Cards, Content Blocks, Feature Flags, Segments, Media Library, and Preference Center" permissions.

If you assign any of the following permissions at a team level, but not a workspace level, you can only do the following assigned to your team:

- Create and edit Canvas templates
- View Canvas templates
- Archive Canvas templates

If permissions are granted at both a workspace and teams level, the workspace level permissions will be prioritized.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can I save an incomplete step in a Canvas template?

Yes, you can save incomplete steps as a Canvas template. However, when the template is used, there will be an error on the **Save template** button that indicates what is needed to launch the Canvas.

### Can I save my Canvas builder settings as a template, or can I only save steps? 

Yes, you can save settings in the Canvas builder within a Canvas template. For example, if you plan to use a combination of segments and filters often, you can save these **Target Audience** settings as part of your Canvas template.
