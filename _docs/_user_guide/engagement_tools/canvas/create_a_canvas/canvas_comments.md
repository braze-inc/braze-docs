# Commenting in Canvas

> Comments in Canvases can be a great collaborative space for your marketing team to identify, discuss, and review the finer details for your Canvases. As you build out a Canvas, you can make and manage comments to identify these areas that may require additional feedback from your colleagues.

## Benefits

Some benefits of commenting in your Canvas include:
- Keeping all details and discussions about a Canvas within a Canvas
- Reviewing edits to a Canvas and encouraging a sign-off process on these changes
- Collaborating in real-time by tagging and responding to other users 
- Identifying granular details of a Canvas, such as specific segmentation, including properties and attributes that are unique to a Canvas

## How to comment

By default, the sidebar will show open comments. You can toggle to view open comments, resolved comments, and all comments by using the <i class="fa-solid fa-sliders"></i> filter icon. You can also toggle to view comments “For you,” which will show threads you are tagged in.

To leave a comment, click the <i class="fas fa-comment"></i> comment icon at the top of the Canvas. This turns your cursor into a comment icon. Click the step you want to comment on. To revert your cursor, press the **Esc** key or click the comment icon again. 

##### Keyboard shortcuts

You can also use keyboard shortcuts to add comments:

| Mac | Windows |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>|
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> | <kbd>Tab</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation" }

To view an existing comment, open the sidebar or select the <i class="fas fa-comment"></i> comment icon next to the step name. You can also reply to existing comments in a thread. 

## Managing comments

You can delete comments and threads you have created by clicking the <i class="fa-solid fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> menu icon in your comment. If a red circle appears next to a comment, this indicates the comment is unread.

You won't be able to delete another user's comments or threads. However, anyone can resolve a comment by selecting **Resolve Thread**.

## Managing notifications

![][2]{: style="float:right;max-width:70%;margin-left:15px;"}

To manage email notifications for a Canvas, open the sidebar and click <i class="fa-solid fa-bell"></i> **Notifications**. Here, you can select your notification preferences.

Selecting **All New Comments** notifies you about new threads started on a Canvas, which also includes when comments are resolved or re-opened. Selecting **Mentions or Replies** notifies you about new comments you're tagged in or threads you're participating in.

To turn off comments notifications for a Canvas, select **None**. By default, the creator of a Canvas is opted-in to be notified of all new comments, and other users are opted-in to be notified of mentions or replies.

Note the **Comments within Canvases** toggle under these notification preferences controls whether you're opted-in or opted-out of notifications across all Canvases. So, if you turn off this setting, you won't receive any email notifications about any comment actions.
