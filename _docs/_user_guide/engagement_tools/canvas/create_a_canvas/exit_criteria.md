# Exit criteria

> By adding [exception events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/exception_events) directly to your Canvas entry rules, your users can exit your Canvas as soon as the event happens at the end of the step. This helps achieve a more targeted approach to Canvas messaging with your audience.

In the **Target Audience** step of the Canvas builder, you can set up exit criteria to identify which users you want to exit your Canvas. Add your exception event, then select **Add Trigger**. 

You can also include segments and filters in the exit criteria, meaning users who match the segment or filter will exit the Canvas and will not receive any further messaging. If the first step in a Canvas is a Delay step with a five-day delay, then the exit criteria will apply at the end of this step. So, if a user meets the exit criteria, they will exit at the end of the five days.

- Making a purchase
- Starting a session
- Performing a custom event
- Performing a conversion event
- Adding an email address
- Changing a custom attribute value
- Updating a subscription status

## Use case

Let's say you want to target users who haven't made any purchases at your company yet. First, select **Make Purchase** as the exception event. Next, select **Add Trigger**. When your Canvas launches, your audience will exclude users who have made any purchases with the following **Exit Criteria** settings. 

In the following example, this exit criteria is also applied to the "Used in last day" segment for any user who has made exactly one purchase.
