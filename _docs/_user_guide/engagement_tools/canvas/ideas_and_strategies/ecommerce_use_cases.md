### Abandoned cart product personalization for emails {#abandoned-cart-checkout}

Abandoned cart user journeys require a special `shopping_cart` Liquid tag for product personalization. 

Here is an example of how you would add an HTML block with your `shopping_cart` Liquid tag to add products into your email. 

{% raw %}
```java
<table style="width:100%">
  {% shopping_cart {{context.${cart_id}}} %}
  {% for item in shopping_cart.products %}
  {% catalog_items <add_your_catalog_name> {{item.variant_id}} %}
  <tr>
    <th><img src="{{ items[0].variant_image_url }}" width="200" height="200"><img></th>
    <th align="left">
      <ul style="list-style-type: none">
        <li>Item: {{ item.product_name }}</li>
        <li>Price: ${{ item.price }}</li>
        <li>Quantity: ${{ item.quantity }}</li>
        <li>Variant ID: {{ item.variant_id }}</li>
        <li>Product URL:{{ item.product_url }}</li>
        <li>SKU: {{ item.metadata.sku }}</li>
      </ul>
    </th>
  </tr>
  {% endfor %}
</table>
```
{% endraw %}

{% alert note %}
If you use Shopify, add your catalog name to get the variant image URL. 
{% endalert %}

#### HTML cart URL

If you want to direct users back to their cart, you can add a nested event property under the medata object, such as:

{% raw %}
```liquid
{{context.${metadata}.cart_url}}
```
{% endraw %}

If you use Shopify, create your cart URL by using this Liquid template:

{% raw %}
```liquid
{{context.source}}/checkouts/cn/{{context.cart_id}}
```
{% endraw %}

## Abandoned checkout

Use the **Abandoned checkout** template to target customers who started the checkout process but left before placing their order.

    </th>
    {% endfor %}
</table>
```
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
```json
<table style="width:100%">

## Message personalization

[Liquid]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/) is a powerful templating language used by Braze that allows you to create dynamic and personalized content for your customers. By using Liquid tags, you can customize messages based on customer data, product information, and other variables, enhancing the shopping experience and driving engagement.

### Key features of Liquid

- **Dynamic content:** Insert customer-specific information such as names, order details, and preferences into your messages.
- **Conditional logic:** Use if/else statements to display different content based on specific conditions (such as customer location and purchase history).
- **Loops:** Iterate over collections of products or customer data to display lists or grids of items.

### Getting started with Liquid

To begin personalizing your messages using Liquid tags, you can refer to the following resources:

- [Shopify data]({{site.baseurl}}/shopify_features/#shopify-data) reference with pre-defined liquid tags
- [Liquid]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/)

## Segmentation

Use Braze segments to create targeted customer segments based on specific attributes and behaviors, and deliver personalized messaging and campaigns. With this powerful feature, you can effectively engage your customers by reaching the right audience with the right message at the right time.

For more information on getting started with segments, check out [About Braze segments]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments#about-braze-segments).

### Recommended events

eCommerce events are based on [recommended events]({{site.baseurl}}/recommended_events/).
Because recommended events are more opinionated custom events, you can search for the recommended eCommerce event names by selecting any [custom event filter]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/custom_data/custom_events/#segmentation-filters).

### eCommerce filters

Segment your users with eCommerce filters, like **Ecommerce Source** and **Total Revenue**, by going to the **Ecommerce** section within the segmenter.

![Segment filters dropdown with "Ecommerce" filters.][7]{: style="max-width:80%"}

{% alert important %}
The purchase event will eventually be deprecated and replaced with [eCommerce recommended events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/custom_data/recommended_events/). When this happens, segment filters will no longer populate under purchase behavior. For a full list of purchase events, refer to [Logging purchase events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/custom_data/purchase_events/#logging-purchase-events). 
{% endalert %}

## Nested event properties

To segment by nested event properties, you can leverage [Segment Extensions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/segment_extension/#why-use-segment-extensions). For example, you can use Segment Extensions to find who has bought the product “SKU-123” in the last 90 days.

## Analytics

{% alert note %}
At this time, the Shopify integration doesn’t support populating the Braze [purchase event]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/purchase_events#purchase-events). As a result, purchase filters, Liquid tags, action-based triggered, and analytics should use the ecommerce.order_placed event. 
{% endalert %}

To create a [Custom Events report]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_events#analytics) based on who has performed an event supported through the integration, you can specify the specific [event name]({{site.baseurl}}/shopify_data_features/).

To gain insights into the trends related to orders placed from your launched Canvases, you will need to set up a [Conversions Dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/analytics/conversions_dashboard#conversions-dashboard) and specify your Canvases.

For more advanced reporting use cases, you can use the Braze [Query Builder]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/query_builder/) to generate custom reports.
