# Archiving Canvases

> To stop a Canvas from sending or to remove it from your dashboard, you can archive a Canvas. 

Go to the **Canvas** page, click the <i class="fas fa-gear"></i> gear icon next to the selected Canvas, and click **Archive**.

There are also bulk actions you can use, such as archiving multiple Canvases, by checking the boxes next to the Canvases and selecting the relevant button.

When you archive a Canvas, no further messages from the Canvas will be sent. You can view all previously archived Canvases by selecting the **Archived** status on the **Canvas** page.

## Unarchiving Canvases

You can also choose to unarchive a Canvas. You can either search for the Canvas, or go to the list of your archived Canvases on the **Canvas** page. Then, click the <i class="fas fa-gear"></i> gear icon next to the selected Canvas, and click **Unarchive**. Note that when you unarchive a Canvas, the associated archived segments will also be unarchived.
