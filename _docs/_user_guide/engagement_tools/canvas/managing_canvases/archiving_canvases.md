# Archiving canvases

> This reference article explains how to archive a pre-existing Canvas and the effects of archiving a Canvas.

To stop a Canvas from sending or to remove it from your Dashboard, you can archive a Canvas. Go to the **Canvas** page, click the gear icon next to the selected Canvas, and click **Archive**.

There are also bulk actions you can use, such as archiving multiple Canvases, by checking the boxes next to the Canvases and selecting the revelant button.

When you archive a Canvas, the following will apply:
- No further messages from the Canvas will be sent.
- Segments associated with the archived Canvas will also be archived.

You can view all previously archived Canvases in the **Archived folder** on the **Canvas** page.
