# Saving drafts for Canvas

> As you create and launch Canvases, you can edit an active Canvas and save it as a draft, allowing you to pilot your changes before another launch. 

If you have an active Canvas that requires large-scale changes, you can use this feature to create drafts for these edits. As with any Canvas, only one user can edit a draft at a time.

You can create drafts within an active Canvas to build, save, and quality-check **prior** to launching these changes in the active Canvas. A Canvas can only have one draft at a time. These drafts don't have any analytics since the draft changes haven't been launched yet.

To create a draft, go to an active Canvas and select the **Save as Draft** button in the Canvas footer. Note that edits to the active Canvas cannot be made while a draft of a Canvas exists. You can update the Canvas to apply changes or discard the draft. 

To reference the active Canvas, select **View Active Canvas** in the footer from the analytics view or the Canvas header from the draft. To return to an active Canvas, select **Edit Draft** from the analytics view or the active Canvas view.

### In-app message prioritization

For drafts of an active Canvas, the in-app message priority within the Canvas builder will be updated immediately when a user changes the priority. This means Canvas-level in-app message priority is applied to the active Canvas immediately, even when a draft exists. 

However, step-level in-app message priority changes are saved as a draft and applied when the Canvas is updated. For example, in a Message step, the priority sorter will be updated when a user launches the draft since step settings apply at a step level.
