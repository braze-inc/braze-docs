# Message Step for Canvas
![Canvas Message Step][1]{: style="float:right;max-width:19%;margin-left:15px;"}
Message Steps allow you to add a standalone message where you want in your Canvas flow.

## Create a Message Step

To create a Message Step, add a step to your Canvas. Then, use the drop-down at the top of the new step to select Message Step.

Then simply set up your messages as you do now in the “Messages” section of the Full Step.

With a Message Step, all uses who enter the step advance to the next step when any one of the following conditions is met:
- Any message is sent
- A message is not sent because the user is not reachable with a channel
- A message is not sent because it is frequency capped
- A message is not sent because it is aborted
