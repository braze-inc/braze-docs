# About landing pages

> Braze landing pages are standalone webpages that can drive your user acquisition and engagement strategy.

## Prerequisites

Before you can access, create, and publish landing pages, you either need administrator permissions or all of the following permissions:

- Access Landing Pages
- Create Landing Page Drafts
- Publish Landing Pages

## Plan tiers

The number of published landing pages and custom domains you can use depends on your plan type: free or paid (incremental).

We plan to release additional features for landing pages, which are in development. These may include:

* New Liquid tag for linking a landing page in a Braze messaging channel
* Automatic user merging when a landing page is sent through a Braze channel
* Basic reporting page
* Drag-and-drop form blocks for checkboxes and dropdowns
* Standard event for tracking and retargeting based on form submissions

While these features are part of our roadmap, they are still in development, and Braze cannot guarantee that any or all of these features will be made generally available. Access to some or all of the planned features for landing pages may be subject to additional fees.
