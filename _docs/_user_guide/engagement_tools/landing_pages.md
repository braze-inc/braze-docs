# About landing pages

> Braze landing pages are standalone web pages that can drive your user acquisition and engagement strategy.

Use landing pages to grow your audience, capture user data, promote special offers, and support multichannel campaigns.

## Prerequisites

Before you can access, create, and publish landing pages, you either need administrator [permissions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_your_braze_users/user_permissions/#list-of-permissions) or all the following permissions:

- Access Landing Pages
- Create Landing Page Drafts
- Publish Landing Pages

Check with your Braze admin if you’re unsure about your permission level.

## Plan tiers

The number of published landing pages and custom domains you can use depends on your plan type: free or paid (incremental).
