You'll then be redirected to a cropping composer where you can select your ratio type, and edit the name of the new image. Once you hit **Save**, your new image can be used!

### My image keeps timing out when I try to upload it. What can I do about this?

This can happen for a variety of reasons, but a common solution is to make sure your image is optimized before attempting to upload it. This means running your image through an image optimizer such as [ImageOptim][5].

Additionally, if your image was built in Photoshop (or a similar software) and has many layers, merging and reducing the number of layers can also help.

### Why can't I upload any image I want into the push composers?

This is because most composers have restrictions on the image ratio size that is allowed.
