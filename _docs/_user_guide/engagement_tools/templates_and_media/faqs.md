# Media library FAQs

> This page provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Braze Media Library.

### Are there storage limits for images within the Media Library?

No, there are no storage limits for images within the Media Library.

### Are there expiration dates for uploaded assets?

No, uploaded assets will not expire once added to the Media Library.

### Can I crop all image types?

No, the Media Library doesn't support cropping GIF images.

### How do I crop an existing image?

You can crop an existing image by selecting the image from the Media Library and clicking **Crop & Save New Image**. 

![Media Library Crop][2]{: height="75%" width="75%"}

You'll then be redirected to a cropping composer where you can select your ratio type, and edit the name of the new image. Once you hit **Save**, your new image can be used!

### My image keeps timing out when I try to upload it. What can I do about this?

This can happen for a variety of reasons, but a common solution is to make sure your image is optimized before attempting to upload it. This means running your image through an image optimizer (such as [ImageOptim][5]).

Additionally, if your image was built in Photoshop (or a similar software) and has many layers, merging and reducing the number of layers can also help.

### Why can't I upload any image I want into the push composers?

This is because most composers have restrictions on the image ratio size that is allowed.
