# Frequently asked questions

> This page provides answers to frequently asked questions about the media library in Braze.

### Are there storage limits for images within the media library?

No, there are no storage limits for assets within the media library. However, there are size limits for assets (maximum 5 MB).

### Are there expiration dates for uploaded assets?

No, assets uploaded to the media library will be retained for the entire duration of your contract with Braze.

### Can I upload video assets?

No, the media library doesn't support video files. We recommend you host these externally, or on a platform such as YouTube.

### Can I crop all image types?

No, the media library doesn't support cropping GIF images.

### How do I crop an existing image?

You can crop an existing image by selecting the image from the media library and clicking **Crop & Save New Image**. 

![Preview of media library image.]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/media_library_crop1.png %}){: height="75%" width="75%"}

You'll then be redirected to a cropping composer where you can select your ratio type, and edit the name of the new image. When you select **Save**, your new image can be used.

### My image keeps timing out when I try to upload it. What can I do about this?

This can happen for a variety of reasons, but a common solution is to make sure your image is optimized before attempting to upload it. This means running your image through an image optimizer such as [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac).

Additionally, if your image was built in Photoshop (or a similar software) and has many layers, merging and reducing the number of layers can also help.

### Why can't I upload any image I want into the push composers?

This is because most composers have restrictions on the image ratio size that is allowed.
