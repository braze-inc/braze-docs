# Media library

> The Media Library allows you to manage your assets in a single, centralized location. To access this feature go into the **Media Library** tab in the [Templates & Media][4] section of your dashboard.

You can use the **Media Library** to:

* Upload multiple images at one time
* Upload Virtual Contact Files (.vcf)
* Upload a folder with your images (max 50 images)
* [Generate an image using AI](#generate-ai) and store it in the Media Library
* Crop an existing image to create the right ratio for your messages
* Add tags or teams to help further organize your images
* Search by tags or teams in the Media Library grid
* Drag and drop images or folders to be uploaded
* Delete images

![Media Library page that includes an "Upload To Library" section to drag and drop or upload files. There is also a list of uploaded content in the Media Library.][1]

{% alert tip %} For more help with the Media Library, check out our [Templates & Media FAQs]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/faqs). {% endalert %}

## Image details

Within the Media Library, you can see the image type, size, dimensions, URL, and date it was added to the library.

## Image specifications

All images uploaded to the Media Library must be less than 5MB. Supported file types are PNG, JPEG, and GIF. For specific image recommendations by messaging channel, refer to the following sections.

### Content Cards

| Card type | Aspect ratio     | Image quality       |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Classic   | 1:1 aspect ratio | 60px by 60px        |
| Captioned | 4:3 aspect ratio | 600px minimum width |
| Banner    | Any aspect ratio | 600px minimum width |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3}

For more information, refer to [Content Card creative details]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/creative_details/).

### Email

| Image type   | Aspect ratio     | Image quality       |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Header image | Any aspect ratio | 600px maximum width |
| Body image   | Any aspect ratio | 480px maximum width |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3}

Smaller, high quality images will load faster, so we recommend that you use the smallest asset possible to achieve your desired output.

### In-app messages

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Full screen %}

| Layout | Aspect ratio | Image quality | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Image and text | 6:5 aspect ratio | High resolution 1200px by 1000px<br><br>Minimum resolution 600px by 500px | Cropping can occur on all sides, but the image will always fill the top 50% of the viewport. |
| Image only | 3:5 aspect ratio | High resolution 1200px by 2000px<br><br>Minimum resolution 600px by 1000px | Cropping can occur on the left and right edges on taller devices. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3 .reset-td-br-4}

{% endtab %}
{% tab Modal %}

| Layout | Aspect ratio | Image quality | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Image and text | 29:10 aspect ratio | High resolution 1450px by 500px<br><br>Minimum resolution 600px by 205px | Tall images will scale down and be horizontally centered. Wide images will be clipped on the left and right edges. |
| Image only | Nearly any aspect ratio | High resolution 1200px by 2000px<br><br>Minimum resolution 600px by 600px | The message will resize to fit images of most aspect ratios.|

{% endtab %}
{% tab Slideup %}

| Layout | Aspect ratio | Image quality | Notes |

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

For more information, refer to [In-app message creative details]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/creative_details/).

### Push

{% tabs local %}
{% tab iOS %}

| Aspect ratio | Image quality | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 2:1 aspect ratio (recommended) | 1038px by 1038px maximum | As of January 2020, iOS rich push notifications can handle images 1038px by 1038px as long as they are under 10MB, but we recommend using as small a file size as possible. In practice, sending large files can cause both unnecessary network stress and make download timeouts more common.|
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3}

## Accessing the Media Library from a message composer

The Media Library acts as your dashboard's centralized location for assets, as all images are uploaded directly to it. This lets you re-use images across different messages.

![Two common ways of accessing the Media Library depending on the message composer. One shows the email Drag and Drop Editor with the title "Images and GIFs" and a button to "Add from Media Library". The other shows the standard editors, such as push and in-app messages, with the title "Media" and a button to "Add Image".][1.5]{: style="border:none"}

## Generate an image using AI {#generate-ai}

You can generate images for your Media Library using [DALLÂ·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/), an AI system from OpenAI that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. Each request generates four variations of your prompt, and your company can generate images 10 times per day. This total applies to all users in your company. You own any images generated by this tool and may use them as you see fit per OpenAI's [Terms of Use](https://openai.com/terms/).

1. From the Media Library, click <i class="fas fa-wand-magic-sparkles"></i> **AI Image Generator**.
2. Enter a description of the image you want to generate, up to 300 characters. The more detailed the description, the better your result.
3. Click **Generate Images**. It can take about a minute for images to generate.
4. Click <i class="fas fa-download" title="Add image to Media Library"></i> on the images you like to add them to your Media Library.
