# Media library

> The media library allows you to manage your assets in a single, centralized location. 

You can find the **Media Library** under **Templates**.

{% alert note %}
If you are using the [older navigation]({{site.baseurl}}/navigation), this page is located under **Templates & Media**.
{% endalert %}

You can use the **Media Library** to:

* Upload multiple images at one time
* Upload Virtual Contact Files (.vcf)
* Upload a folder with your images (maximum 50 images)
* [Generate an image using AI](#generate-ai) and store it in the media library
* Crop an existing image to create the right ratio for your messages
* Add tags or teams to help further organize your images
* Search by tags or teams in the media library grid
* Drag and drop images or folders to be uploaded
* Delete images

![Media Library page that includes an "Upload To Library" section to drag and drop or upload files. There is also a list of uploaded content in the media library.][1]

## Image details

Within the media library, you can see the image type, size, dimensions, URL, and date it was added to the library.

### Using the media library versus a CDN

Using the media library provides better caching and performance for in-app messages. All media library assets found in an in-app message will be pre-cached for faster display and will be available for offline display. Additionally, the media library is integrated with Braze composers, allowing marketers to select or tag images instead of copying and pasting image URLs.

## Image specifications

All images uploaded to the media library must be less than 5&nbsp;MB. Supported file types are PNG, JPEG, and GIF. For specific image recommendations by messaging channel, refer to the following sections.

### Content Cards

{% multi_lang_include image_specs.md variable_name='content cards' %}

### Email

{% multi_lang_include image_specs.md variable_name="email"  %}

### In-app messages

{% multi_lang_include image_specs.md variable_name="in-app messages"  %}

For more information, refer to [In-app message creative details]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/creative_details/).

### Push

{% multi_lang_include image_specs.md variable_name="push notifications"  %}

## Accessing the media library from a message composer

The media library acts as your dashboard's centralized location for assets, as all images are uploaded directly to it. This lets you reuse images across different messages.

![Two common ways of accessing the media library depending on the message composer. One shows the email Drag and Drop Editor with the title "Images and GIFs" and a button to "Add from Media Library". The other shows the standard editors, such as push and in-app messages, with the title "Media" and a button to "Add Image".][1.5]{: style="border:none"}

## Generate an image using AI {#generate-ai}

You can generate images for your media library using [DALL·E 3](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/), an AI system from OpenAI, a Braze third-party provider. This system can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. Each request generates four variations of your prompt, and your company can generate images 10 times per day. This total applies to all users in your company.

1. From the media library, select <i class="fas fa-wand-magic-sparkles"></i> **AI Image Generator**.
2. Enter a description of the image you want to generate, up to 300 characters. The more detailed the description, the better your result.
3. Select **Generate Images**. It can take about a minute for images to generate.
4. Select <i class="fas fa-download" title="Add image to Media Library"></i> on the images you would like to add to your media library.
