# Content calendar

> The content calendar offers a high-level overview for your upcoming scheduled campaigns.

You can analyze messaging data, as well as view and manage your scheduled campaigns. To open the calendar, select **Messaging** > **Content Calendar**.

## Messaging analytics

The messaging analytics section contains two reports for your recent and upcoming scheduled campaigns:

- **Upcoming Message Types:** The number of push, email, and in-app messaging campaigns scheduled within the next 14 days.
- **Messages Sent:** The number of messages sent and opened within past 14 days.

You can view messaging analytics for a specific day in a report by placing your cursor over that day in the report.

To download a copy of your data, select <i class="fa-solid fa-bars" style="color: #2e7487;"></i> **Chart context menu**, then choose your preferred file format.

## Send calendar

The send calendar displays all your scheduled campaigns for the current month.

{% alert note %}
In-app messages are always action-based, so you won't see any in-app message campaigns in the send calendar.
{% endalert %}

You can change the month by selecting <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-left" style="color: #2e7487;"></i>&nbsp;**See previous month** or <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-right" style="color: #2e7487;"></i>&nbsp;**See next month**. To return to the current month, select **Today**.

Each color on the calendar represents a different scheduled campaign type:

- **Red:** Single-channel scheduled campaigns.
- **Blue:** Multichannel scheduled campaigns.
- **Gold:** Stopped campaigns, which are included in the calendar for historical reference.

You can view or modify your campaigns by selecting the campaign in the calendar. For more information, see [Managing campaigns]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/managing_campaigns).
