# Retargeting campaigns

> This reference article goes over the concept of retargeting campaigns and how it can be a beneficial marketing strategy.

> By retargeting campaigns based on the user's previous actions, like whether or not they opened an email, you can help reclassify your users, opening the door to an effective, data-driven marketing approach.

Braze provides support for retargeting users based on messages they have received. You can retarget users based upon their interactions with your campaigns, Canvases, and News Feed cards. 

Each of these retargeting filters provides you with several options after you add them. For more on targeting users, check out our [Braze Learning course](https://learning.braze.com/campaign-setup-delivery-targeting-conversions) on campaign setup!

## Advantages with retargeting campaigns

Retargeting is particularly effective when the original segment also included a specific action you want to see users take. For example, let's say you have a card targeted at users who have never made a purchase. The card advertises a promotion for a discounted in-app purchase. The initial segment looks like the following:

- Money Spent in App is exactly 0
- Last Used App less than 14 days ago

The total number of users in the segment is 100,000 and you know from the News Feed stats that 60,000 unique users viewed the card and 20,000 unique users clicked the card. Through the segmenter we can see how many of those users who clicked the card actually made a purchase:

- Money Spent in App is more than 0
- Clicked Card is Name of Card

After examining those stats, we can make a segment of users who clicked the card, but did not make a purchase:

- Money Spent in App is exactly than 0
- Clicked Card is Name of Card

We can retarget this segment with additional messaging around the promotion or another in-app purchase. Retargeting can be done with another News Feed card or through a messaging campaign. A multichannel approach allows you to reach users where theyâ€™re most likely to respond, thus increasing the effectiveness of your campaigns.
