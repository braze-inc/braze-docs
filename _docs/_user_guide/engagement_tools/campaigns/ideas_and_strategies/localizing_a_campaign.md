# Localizing a campaign

> This reference article briefly goes over the information Braze collects from SDK integration and how it is used to classify locale and customize a user's experience. 

Braze automatically collects relevant data to help you localize campaigns. Our customers send localized content on a daily basis to their audience to keep content relevant and accessible.

## Technical details

Braze automatically collects locale information from user devices after the SDK has been integrated. The locale contains a language and region identifier.

For example, a user who has set their device to English (US) will have a language `EN`. The user's country is collected from their device IP address. These filters will be available in Braze's segmentation tool under **Country and Language**.

![A list of user attributes: Age, Country, Email Available, Gender, Language, Location Available, and Push Enabled.][7]

Check out the following resources for more technical details on how locale is retrieved based on your platform:

- [iOS][1]
- [Android][2]
- [Windows Store][3]
- [Windows Phone][4]

## Internationalize campaigns

You can take advantage of this language identifier and our personalization capabilities to internationalize campaigns. For more information on internationalization, see [Campaigns in multiple languages][12]

Braze automatically collects the most recent location of users' devices (if location permission is granted to your app). You can use this information to run a localized campaign that is targeted at users within a specific geographic area. For more information, see [Location targeting][13].
