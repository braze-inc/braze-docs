# Automate Zoom attendee registration

Webinars have become common for Braze customers to host over the past few years. When hosting a Zoom webinar, users must enter their information on a Zoom landing page to sign up. A recommended user flow is outlined below:

1. Schedule a webinar in Zoom and generate a `meetingId`.
2. Use Braze to promote Zoom webinars via email, push, and in-app message channels. 
3. Include a call-to-action button in these communications that automatically adds users to the webinar.

This can be accomplished by using the [Zoom APIs](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api/methods/#operation/meetingRegistrantCreate) to automatically add a user to a webinar through a button click within an email, push, or in-app message. Use the following endpoint, replacing the meeting ID in the API request. 

POST: `/meetings/{meetingId}/registrants`

For more information, refer to the Zoom [Add meeting registrant](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api/methods/#operation/meetingRegistrantCreate) endpoint.<br><br>

{% tabs %}
{% tab Email %}

Create an email campaign with a call-to-action button within the message body. Once a user clicks the button, redirect them to the webinar landing page (with appropriate parameters included in the redirect link). 

Using the parameters in the URL to pass user data, build an API call to fire when the page loads to add the user to the webinar.

Users are now registered for the webinar with the details that already exist on their Braze profile.

{% tab Push %}
