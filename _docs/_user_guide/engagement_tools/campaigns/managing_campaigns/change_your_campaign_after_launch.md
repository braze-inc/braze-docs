# Changing your campaign after launch

> This article gives an overview of the result of editing certain aspects of a campaign post-launch.

## Stopping your campaign

To stop a campaign, open your **Campaign Details** page and select the **Stop Campaign** button in the bottom right of the page. When a campaign is stopped:
- Messages scheduled to be sent will be canceled
- A/B tests where the initial test has already been sent will be permanently canceled
- Events for messages that have already been sent (e.g., open clicks) will still be tracked
- Campaigns can be restarted by clicking **Resume**

Once resumed, this campaign will continue sending messages and A/B tests, but any missed messages will not be re-sent or re-scheduled.

## Triggered campaigns

All changes to Action-Based Delivery campaigns and API-Triggered Delivery campaigns take effect immediately for go-forward sends.

If these campaigns have been triggered, but not yet sent (for example, an Action-Based Delivery campaign with a 1-day delay is edited during the 1-day delay period), refer to the following guidance for scheduled campaigns.

## Scheduled campaigns

If you need to make changes to a campaign post-launch, take note of the following items when editing your campaign to ensure your changes have the desired effects.

### Message content

Any message content changes (including titles, bodies, images, etc.) take effect immediately on saving for all message sends going forward. It is not possible to change the contents of messages that have already been dispatched.

### Scheduling and audience

If you edit your campaign's scheduled send time or its audience, those changes are reflected in the actual campaign immediately.

### Send rate

When using a send rate limit, Braze "schedules" your messages in minute-granularity time slots, so if you want to change the message sending rate, adhere to the following process for making immediate changes.

## Making immediate changes

If you need changes to take effect immediately, do the following:

1. Stop the affected campaign.
2. Duplicate the campaign.
3. Make edits on the duplicate campaign.

This resets eligibility for people who already received the original campaign, so you may need to filter the duplicate campaign for people who did not receive the original.
