# Searching for campaigns

> As you build more campaigns in your workspace, you can adjust the filters and columns in the campaign list to sort and organize these campaigns. Using a combination of these search methods can help to narrow down your results, especially as your list of campaigns grows.

There are several ways you can search for campaigns on the campaign list page by selecting:

- Status
- Tags
- Filters
- Columns

You can use the search bar to enter keywords and phrases that are related to your campaign name. To do an exact search, use quotation marks ("") to surround your search phrase. For example, to search specifically for webhook test campaigns, enter `"webhook test"` in the search bar.

### Selecting a status

By default, the campaign list will show your active and idle campaigns. You can select the dropdown to view campaigns by their status (active, draft, archived, stopped, and idle).

For example, if you want to audit your campaign drafts, select **Status** > **Draft** to focus your campaign list.

### Searching by tags

Searching your campaigns by [tags]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/tags/) can further narrow down your results. For example, if you're trying to find all the campaigns you built for targeting new customers, frequent buyers, lapsed customers, you could search these campaigns by their shared tag **Targeting by customer type**.

### Adjusting filters

Use the filters to group results by the following campaign details:

- Campaign type 
- Who created the campaign
- Who last edited the campaign
- Entry schedule
- Target segment
- Teams
- Campaigns with expired interaction data

You can also search by selecting the date range for when the campaign was last created or last edited. This can be especially useful if you're searching for campaigns used during a promotional period.

### Organizing columns

When you select **Columns**, you can adjust the information of the campaign list page to display relevant campaign details by selecting the respective checkboxes. For example, if  you want to set up the campaign list to show only action-based webhook campaigns by your marketing team, you could select **Campaign type**, **Entry schedule**, and **Teams** as your columns.
