# Archiving campaigns

> Archiving campaigns can be a simple and effective way of organizing your workspace. As you continue building more campaigns, you can make sure your focus is on active and relevant messaging efforts.

To stop a campaign from sending or clear it from your dashboard, you can archive it:

1. Go to **Messaging** > **Campaigns**.
2. Hover over the campaign's row and select the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> menu. 
3. Select **Archive**.

When you archive a campaign, no further messages from that campaign will be delivered. In the case of in-app messages, no further in-app messages from that campaign will be displayed to users.

There are also bulk actions you can use by selecting the checkboxes next to the campaigns and selecting the relevant option.

## Unarchiving campaigns

While selecting an archived campaign will allow you to view its past results, you won't be able to edit the campaign. You'll need to unarchive the campaign to edit it. To unarchive a campaign:

2. Hover over the archived campaign's row and select the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> menu. 
3. Select **Unarchive**.

Unarchiving a campaign doesn't make it live. This just updates your campaign status to **Active**. At this point, you can edit and review how the campaign is set up, and your campaign will be stopped and won't send any messages.

If you want to resume the campaign and begin sending messages, select the gear icon next to the campaign and select **Resume**.
