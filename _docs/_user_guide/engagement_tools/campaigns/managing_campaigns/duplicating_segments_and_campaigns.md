# Duplicating segments, campaigns, and Canvases

> Not only is duplicating engagement tools a time-saver, but it also allows you to continually build off and iterate over successful campaigns, segments, and Canvases.

Braze allows you to duplicate pre-existing segments, campaigns, and Canvases. This can be useful in cases where you wish to create a new engagement tool that is very similar to an old one. By our cloning feature, you can create a second version of an old segment, campaign, or Canvas and make the necessary edits.

For more on segments and campaigns, check out our [Braze Learning course](https://learning.braze.com/quick-overview-segment-and-campaign-setup)!

## Cloning a segment

To clone a segment, click the gear icon next to a segment and select **Duplicate**. Your new segment will automatically be titled "Copy of [Original Segment]" and you'll be brought to its editing page.

## Cloning a campaign

To clone a campaign, click the gear icon next to a campaign and select **Duplicate**. Your new campaign will automatically be titled "Copy of [Original Campaign]" and you'll be brought to its editing page. Duplicates of campaigns will remain drafts until you edit and launch them.

## Cloning a Canvas

To clone a Canvas, click the gear icon next to a Canvas and select **Duplicate**. Your new Canvas will automatically be titled "Copy of [Original Canvas]" and you'll be brought to its editing page. Duplicates of Canvases will remain drafts until you edit and launch them.
