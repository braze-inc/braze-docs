# Duplicating segments, campaigns, and Canvases

> You can duplicate pre-existing segments, campaigns, and Canvases to continually iterate and build off your successful strategies. You can duplicate these items when viewing them as a list on their respective page in the dashboard (Segments, Campaigns, or Canvas).

For more on segments and campaigns, check out our [Braze Learning course](https://learning.braze.com/quick-overview-segment-and-campaign-setup)!

## Duplicating segments or campaigns

To duplicate a segment or campaign, click <i class="fas fa-gear"></i> **More actions** next to the list item and select **Duplicate**. Your new segment or campaign will automatically be titled "Copy of [Original Name]" and you'll be brought to its editing page. Duplicates of campaigns will remain in drafts until your edit and launch them.

## Duplicating Canvases

{% alert important %}
As of February 28, 2023, you can no longer create or duplicate Canvases using the original Canvas experience. Braze recommends that customers who use the original Canvas experience move to Canvas Flow. It's an improved editing experience to better build and manage Canvases. Learn more about [cloning your Canvases to Canvas Flow]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/managing_canvases/cloning_canvases/).
{% endalert %}

To duplicate a Canvas, click <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> **More actions** next to a Canvas and select **Duplicate**. Your new Canvas will automatically be titled "Copy of [Original Name]" and you'll be brought to its editing page. Duplicates of Canvases will remain drafts until you edit and launch them.
