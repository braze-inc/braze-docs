# Duplicating Segments and Campaigns

Braze allows you to duplicate pre-existing segments and campaigns. This can be useful in cases where you wish to create a new segment or campaign that is very similar to an old one. By our cloning feature, you can create a second version of an old segment or campaign and make the necessary edits.

For more on Segments and Campaigns, check out our [quick LAB course](http://lab.braze.com/quick-overview-segment-and-campaign-setup)!

## Cloning a Segment

To clone a segment, click the gear icon next to a segment and select "Duplicate." Your new segment will automatically be titled "Copy of [Original Segment]" and you'll be brought to its editing page.

## Cloning a Campaign

To clone a campaign, click the gear icon next to a campaign and select "Duplicate." Your new campaign will automatically be titled "Copy of [Original Campaign]" and you'll be brought to its editing page. Duplicates of campaigns will remain drafts until you edit and launch them.
