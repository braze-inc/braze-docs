# AI copywriting assistant

The AI copywriting assistant passes a brief product name or description to OpenAI's GPT copy generation tool to generate human-like marketing copy for use in your messaging. This functionality is available by default for most message composers in the Braze dashboard.

## Steps

To generate copy using the AI copywriting assistant, follow these steps:

1. From your message composer, select <i class="fa-solid fa-wand-magic-sparkles"></i> **Launch AI Copywriter**.
2. Enter a product name or description in the input field.
3. Select the output language. This can be different from your input language.
4. Select an approximate output length. 
5. Click **Generate Copy**.

The response will be fetched from OpenAI and provided to you. Feel free to experiment and try variations to your heart's content.

## What is GPT?

[GPT](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) is OpenAI's state of the art natural language generation tool powered by artificial intelligence. It can perform a variety of natural language tasks like text generation, completion, and classification. We've plugged it into the Braze dashboard to help inspire and diversify your copy directly as you work.
