## Learning goals

By the end of your onboarding, you should feel comfortable with:

1. Braze terminology,
2. Working with your engineers to integrate Braze,
3. Using Braze as a tool to launch your campaigns, and
4. Setting up and preparing to use email with Braze.

You can follow along with this guide, or you can check out [Braze Learning](https://learning.braze.com)! We have courses for you, as well as a [Technical Integration Toolkit](https://learning.braze.com/technical-integration-checklists-and-toolkits) and [Technical Integration Overview](https://learning.braze.com/quick-overview-technical-integration) available for your developers!

Continue to the next part of the guide, [Terms to Know]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/onboarding_with_braze/terms_to_know/), to familiarize yourself with some common words you'll see in documentation, the product, and from the people of Braze.
