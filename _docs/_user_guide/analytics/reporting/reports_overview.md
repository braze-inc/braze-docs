# Reports overview

> Not sure where to start with analyzing your campaigns? You're in the right place. This page provides guidance on which reports and analytics you can use to answer common marketing strategy questions.

## Which variant won?

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Campaign Analytics %}
**Campaign Analytics**

Use [Campaign Analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/reporting/campaign_analytics/) to get real-time updates on high-level results of each campaign and variant within that campaign, as well as message-level details. You can adjust the date range to understand campaign performance over time and preview your messages to remember what you were testing.

{% endtab %}

{% tab Canvas Analytics %}
**Canvas Analytics**

Use [Canvas Analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/testing_canvases/measuring_and_testing_with_canvas_analytics/) to get top-line statistics on your Canvas to see how your messaging strategy is performing. Open any live Canvas to key performance stats such as:

- Number of messages sent within the Canvas
- Total number of times customers have entered the Canvas
- How many customers have converted
- Revenue generated by the Canvas
- Estimated total audience

<br>

**Performance by Variant**

[Analyze Variants]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/get_started/measuring_and_testing_with_canvas_analytics/#performance-breakdown-by-variant) in a live Canvas to view automatically calculated conversion rates for every conversion event. You can also view uplift and confidence calculations for each variant and conversion event in an easy-to-compare table format.

More questions you can answer with this report:

- Was there statistically significant confidence?
- How did Variant 1 perform versus Variant 2?

{% endtab %}

{% tab Report Builder %}
**Report Builder**

Use the [Report Builder]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/reporting/report_builder/) to compare the results of multiple campaigns or Canvases in a single view and quickly determine which engagement strategies most impacted your key metrics.

Check out this page to:

- Create a report of campaigns and Canvases from the last week or month, calculate critical metrics, and share with your teammates.
- Compare performance across variants for both multivariate tests and Canvases.
- Determine which messaging channel got the most conversion or engagement for a specific campaign or Canvas.
- Track general performance trends of a group of campaigns or Canvases (such as all messages related to a "newsletters" tag).

More questions you can answer with this feature:

- How did the first version of my welcome email perform against the second version?
- What were my average push open rates from this month compared to last month, for a particular tag?
- Which month's newsletter had the most conversions?

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Which variant impacted retention the most?

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Retention Reports %}
**Retention Reports**

Use Retention Reports for [campaigns]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/reporting/retention_reports/) or [Canvases]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/reporting/retention_reports/) to measure retention for users who have performed a selected event in a specific campaign.

Check out this report to:

- Determine how effective a message was for re-engaging users in the long run by analyzing the occurrence of different events up to one month after receiving a campaign.
- Compare the occurrence of different events across variants of an [A/B test]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/testing/multivariant_testing/).

More questions you can answer with this report:

- Which variant impacted retention the most?
- For how long do my customers who received this campaign continue to use my app afterward?
- How did this campaign impact retention after one day? After 30 days?

{% alert note %} Retention Reports are not available for SMS and API-triggered campaigns. {% endalert %}

{% endtab %}
{% tab Funnel Report %}

Use funnel reports for [campaigns]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/reporting/funnel_reports/) or [Canvases]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/reporting/funnel_reports/) to analyze the journeys your customers take after receiving a campaign. You can choose which native or custom events to include in each funnel analysis and then dive into how each variant performs against their selected conversion funnel.

Check out this report to:

- Understand where in the conversion funnel users dropped off and identify opportunities for re-engagement messaging.
- View conversions for an event that was not originally included as a conversion event when setting up the campaign.
- Analyze the purchase funnel using a series of actions (such as "What percent of customers received an email, started a session, added an item to their cart, and then purchased?").

More questions you can answer with this report:

- Where along the path to conversion do my customers fall off?
- How can I improve my marketing strategies?

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs%}

{% endtab %}
{% tab Custom Events %}
**Custom Events**

Use the [Custom Events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_events/#custom-event-analytics) page to monitor how often a custom event has occurred, as well as the last time each user performed it for segmentation.

Check out this page to:

- Monitor custom event frequency
- Monitor custom events by segment
- Analyze how campaigns affect custom event activity
- Create and monitor [KPI Formulas]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/creating_a_formula/)

{% endtab %}
{% tab Global Control Group Report %}

This report lets you compare the behaviors of users who receive messaging with the behaviors of users who don't, providing a better understanding of how your campaigns and Canvases are contributing to your business goals.

Check out this page to:

- Easily measure the impact and incremental uplift of campaigns and Canvases on sessions and custom events.
- Automatically randomize and exclude control group members from receiving messages.
- Export control group members for further analysis.

{% tab Funnel Report %}

Use funnel reports for [campaigns]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/reporting/funnel_reports/) or [Canvases]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/reporting/funnel_reports/) to analyze the journeys your customers take after receiving a campaign.

**Predictive Churn**

[Predictive Churn]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/predictive_churn/) is the first model in the [Braze Predictive Suite]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/). Use Predictive Churn to define and generate predictions, providing a proactive approach toward minimizing future churn.

Since every business defines churn and retention differently, you can simply input your definitions into Predictive Churn, and Braze will do the rest. You can also create campaigns or Canvases to act off the predictions or build segments for further analysis.
