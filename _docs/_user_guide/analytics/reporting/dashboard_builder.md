# Dashboard Builder

> Use Dashboard Builder to create dashboards and visualizations using reports created in Report Builder or Query Builder.

Dashboard Builder empowers you to compose and visualize custom analytic dashboards from scratch and from Braze-supplied templates. You can use either a no-code data source (Report Builder) or SQL data source (Query Builder) to power your dashboard, or start from one of many Braze templates.

## Creating a custom dashboard

1. Go to **Analytics** > **Dashboard Builder**.
2. Select **Create Dashboard**.
3. Select which data source will power your reports:
- **Reports** that were built in Report Builder
- **Custom Queries** that were created in Query Builder<br><br>![Window to select your data source for your dashboard.][4]<br><br>

Now, follow the respective steps for your data source:

{% tabs %}
{% tab Reports %}

{: start="4"}
4. Select **+ Add Tile** and then choose one of the reports you created in [Report Builder (New)]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/reporting/report_builder/).
5. Select the pencil icon to change how the title and chart type display in the tile.
    - You can toggle between different chart types below the default visualization. The current options include bar charts (horizontal or vertical), and line charts (only available if you selected **Date** as a drilldown option in the Report Builder setup).<br><br>![Toggles for different chart types.]({% image_buster /assets/img/report_builder_types.png %})<br><br>
    - Use the metrics dropdown to select which metrics to include in your visualization. By default, the first column in the report will be the default displayed metric.
6. Select **Save** after you've changed the visualization to your liking.
7. Add a name, description, and tag to make your dashboard easier to find later.
{% endtab %}
{% tab Custom Queries %}
{: start="4"}
4. Select **+ Add Tile** and then choose a query you’ve run in Query Builder.
5. To edit how the query results display in the tile, select the pencil icon to change the title and chart type.
    - You can toggle between different chart types below the default visualization. Current options include tables, bar charts (horizontal or vertical), and line charts.<br><br>![Toggles for different chart types.]({% image_buster /assets/img/query_builder_types.png %})<br><br>
        - If you choose one of the chart options, use the **X-axis** dropdown to select a single column from your query results to use as your x axis.
        - Use the **Y-axis** dropdown to select which metrics to include in your visualization. By default, all columns from your query results will display, so de-select the columns you’re not interested in viewing.<br><br>![Toggles for different chart types.]({% image_buster /assets/img/query_builder_axis.png %})<br><br>
        - (Optional) You can use the **Grouping** dropdown to group together your query results. For example, if you have campaign ID as a column result and you want to add together all the rows with that value, use the **Grouping** dropdown.  
        - (Optional) To edit the data being displayed, select the query that is attached to the visual and make your edits in [Query Builder]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/query_builder/). 
6. Select **Save** after you've changed the visualization to your liking.
7. Add a name, description, and tag to make your dashboard easier to find later.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{: start="8"}
8. Repeat steps 4—7 for your respective method until you create your desired dashboard.
9. Select **View Dashboard** > select **Run Dashboard**. 

Your dashboard may take up to a few minutes to finish generating reports.

{% alert note %}
You can add up to 10 tiles to a dashboard.
{% endalert %}

## Managing dashboard tiles

### Delete tiles

Delete a dashboard tile by selecting **Delete Tile** at the bottom of the tile. **This action can’t be reverted.**

### Duplicate tiles

Make a copy of your tile by selecting **Duplicate Tile** at the bottom of the tile.

### Adjust tile size and position

Adjust the tile size by dragging the bottom right corner of the tile, and adjust the tile position on the dashboard by dragging the handle at the top right corner of the tile.

## Running a dashboard template

1. Go to **Analytics** > **Dashboard Builder**. The home page lists all existing dashboards within your workspace, with Braze-created templates at the top. These are denoted with "(Braze)" in the title.
2. Select the dashboard you’re interested in.
3. Select **Run Dashboard** to load the respective dashboard using that template.

### Available dashboard templates

Braze provides pre-built dashboard templates for frequent use cases such as analysis of revenue using last-touch attribution. Note that the ability to edit a template dashboard is not yet available. Reach out to your customer success manager if you'd like to see certain dashboard templates in future template releases.
