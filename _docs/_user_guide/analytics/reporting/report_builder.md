# Report Builder

> This page covers how to use Report Builder to create and view granular reports using Braze data, and how to add reports to dashboards.

## Using a report template

1. Go to **Analytics** > **Report Builder (New)**.
2. Select the **More options** arrow next to the **Create New Report** button, and then select **Use a report template**.<br><br>!["Create New Report" button dropdown with options to create a custom report or use a template.]({% image_buster /assets/img/report_builder_2/create_new_report.png %}){: style="max-width:40%;"}<br><br>
3. Select one of the report templates from the Braze template library.
    - Use the **Row items** and **Tags** dropdown to find relevant reports to your use cases.<br><br>!["Braze report templates" window with list of Braze templates to select from.]({% image_buster /assets/img/report_builder_2/report_templates.png %}){: style="max-width:90%;"}<br><br>
4. Follow step 3 and onward in [Creating a report](#creating-a-report) to further customize the report to fit your use case.

## Creating a report

1. Go to **Analytics** > **Report Builder (New)**.
2. Select **Create New Report**.
3. In the **Rows** dropdown, select what you'd like to report on:
    - Campaigns
    - Canvases
    - Campaigns and Canvases
    - Channels
    - Tags

    Note that your **Rows** selection will impact [the metrics that you can view](#metrics-availability). For example, you can view multivariate metrics only if you report on **Canvases**, or **Campaigns** with a **Variant** drilldown. You cannot view those metrics when reporting on **Campaigns and Canvases**, even if those campaigns and Canvases have multivariate tests. 

![The "Rows and columns" section with fields to select the rows and groupings for your report.]({% image_buster /assets/img/report_builder_2/rows_and_columns.png %}){: style="width:90%;"}

{: start="4"}
4. (Optional) Select **Add drilldown** to break down your data into more granular views:
    - Channels
    - Date
        - Use this to split your data into smaller time ranges. For example, if you're interested in how your campaigns performed by day, select the following configuration:
            - **Rows**: Campaigns
            - **Grouping:** Date
            - **Interval:** Days
    - Variants
    - Campaigns and Canvases

{% alert tip %}
Try out different configurations of drilldown options to explore the [many ways you can break down your data](#metrics-availability). 
{% endalert %}

{: start="5"}
5. In the **Columns** section, select **Customize Metrics**.

![The "Customize Metrics" section with options to select multiple metrics.]({% image_buster /assets/img/report_builder_2/customize_metrics.png %}){: style="width:90%;"}

{: start="6"}
6. Browse metrics by category and select the corresponding checkbox to add a metric to your report. 
    - Reorder the metrics and columns by dragging the dotted icon up or down. 
7. In **Report content**, configure the date range for which you’d like to include data in your report.
8. Then, depending on your selections in step 3, choose to manually or automatically add campaigns, Canvases, or both to your report.
    - **Add manually:** Choose each campaign or Canvas to include in the report by using the filters for **Last Sent** dates and tags or channels, or searching the campaign or Canvas name.<br><br>![The "Manually add campaigns and canvases" section with a list of campaigns to select.]({% image_buster /assets/img/report_builder_2/manually_add.png %}){: style="width:90%;"}<br><br>
    - **Add automatically:** Set rules for which campaigns or Canvases to include in the report. You're only required to select one field on this page.
        - Note that as additional campaigns or Canvases satisfy the conditions you set on this screen, they will automatically be added to future runs of your report.<br><br>![The "Automatically add campaigns and canvases" section with fields to set rules for which campaigns and Canvases should be added to the report.]({% image_buster /assets/img/report_builder_2/automatically_add.png %}){: style="width:90%;"}<br><br>
9. Run the report by selecting **Save & Run**.

{% alert note %}
The report may take up to a few minutes to run, depending on the date range and number of campaigns or Canvases you selected in the configuration stage.
{% endalert %}

## Metrics availability

Your selection for **Rows** affects the metrics you can select.

{% alert tip %}
If you want to report on Canvas variants or steps, select **Canvases** for rows and either leave the field empty or select **Date** as the drilldown. This creates a **Canvas View** dropdown to view metrics for the Canvas only, or group metrics by variant, step, or message. 

![The opened "Canvas View" dropdown.]({% image_buster /assets/img/report_builder_2/canvas_view_dropdown.png %}){: style="width:40%;"}
{% endalert %}
