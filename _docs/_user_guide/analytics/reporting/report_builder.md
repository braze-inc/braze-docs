> This page covers how to use Report Builder to create and view granular reports using Braze data, and how to add reports to dashboards.

## Using a report template

1. Go to **Analytics** > **Report Builder (New)**.
2. Select the **More options** arrow next to the **Create New Report** button, and then select **Use a report template**.<br><br>!["Create New Report" button dropdown with options to create a custom report or use a template.][9]{: style="max-width:40%;"}<br><br>
3. Select one of the report templates from the Braze template library.
    - Use the **Row items** and **Tags** dropdown to find relevant reports to your use cases.<br><br>!["Braze report templates" window with list of Braze templates to select from.][8]{: style="max-width:90%;"}<br><br>
4. Follow step 3 and onward in [Creating a report](#creating-a-report) to further customize the report to fit your use case.

## Creating a report

1. Go to **Analytics** > **Report Builder (New)**.
2. Select **Create New Report**.
3. In the **Rows** dropdown, select one of the following to create a report:
    - Campaigns
    - Canvases
    - Campaigns and Canvases
    - Channels
    - Tags

![The "Rows and columns" section with fields to select the rows and groupings for your report.][1]{: style="width:90%;"}

{: start="4"}
4. (Optional) Select **Add drilldown** to break down your data into more granular views:
    - Channels
    - Date
        - Use this to split your data into smaller timeranges. For example, if you're interested in how your campaigns performed by day, select the following configuration:
            - **Rows**: Campaigns
            - **Grouping:** Date
            - **Interval:** Days
    - Variants
    - Campaigns and Canvases

{% alert tip %}
Try out different configurations of drilldown options to explore the many ways you can break down your data. 
{% endalert %}

{: start="5"}
5. In the **Columns** section, select **Customize Metrics**.

![The "Customize Metrics" section with options to select multiple metrics.][2]{: style="width:90%;"}

{: start="6"}
6. Browse metrics by category and select the corresponding checkbox to add a metric to your report. 
    - Reorder the metrics and columns by dragging the dotted icon up or down. 
7. In **Report content**, configure the date range for which youâ€™d like to include data in your report.
8. Then, depending on your selections in step 3, choose to manually or automatically add campaigns, Canvases, or both to your report.
    - **Add manually:** Choose each campaign or Canvas to include in the report by using the filters for **Last Sent** dates and tags or channels, or searching the campaign or Canvas name.<br><br>![The "Manually add campaigns and canvases" section with a list of campaigns to select.][3]{: style="width:90%;"}<br><br>
    - **Add automatically:** Set rules for which campaigns or Canvases to include in the report. You're only required to select one field on this page.
        - Note that as additional campaigns or Canvases satisfy the conditions you set on this screen, they will automatically be added to future runs of your report.<br><br>![The "Automatically add campaigns and canvases" section with fields to set rules for which campaigns and Canvases should be added to the report.][4]{: style="width:90%;"}<br><br>
9. Run the report by selecting **Save & Run**.

{% alert note %}
The report may take up to a few minutes to run, depending on the date range and number of campaigns or Canvases you selected in the configuration stage.
{% endalert %}

## Viewing a report

After running your report, you can view your results in table format on the report page.

### Creating a report chart

At the bottom of the page you can create a chart of your data by selecting a **Chart type** and configuring the chart metrics. By default, you'll see the first metric.
