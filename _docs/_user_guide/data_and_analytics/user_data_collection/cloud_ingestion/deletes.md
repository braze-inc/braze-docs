# Delete Users with Cloud Data Ingestion

## Source data configuration 

User delete syncs are supported for all available Cloud Data Ingestion data sources. Follow the normal setup steps for the data warehouse you want to connect to, including creating a role that can access the delete table. 

Source tables for user deletes shoudl inclulde one or more user identifier types, and an UPDATED_AT timestamp. Payload columns are not supported for user delete data.

- `UPDATED_AT` - The time this row was updated in or added to the table. We will only sync rows that have been added or updated since the last sync.
- User identifier columns. Your table may contain one or more user identifier columns. Each row should only contain one identifier (either `external_id`, the combination of `alias_name` and `alias_label`, or `braze_id`. A source table may columns for one, two, or all three identifier types. 
    - `EXTERNAL_ID` - This identifies the user you want to update.  This should match the `external_id` value used in Braze. 
    - `ALIAS_NAME` and `ALIAS_LABEL` - These two columns create a user alias object. `alias_name` should be a unique identifier, and `alias_label` specifies the type of alias. Users may have multiple aliases with different labels but only one `alias_name` per `alias_label`.
    - `BRAZE_ID` - The Braze user identifier. This is generated by the Braze SDK and new users cannot be created using a Braze ID through Cloud Data Ingestion. To create new users, specify an external user ID or user alias. 
- DO NOT include a `PAYLOAD`column - to prevent accidental, permanent, deletes of users, a sync will fail if a payload column is provided in the source table. Any other columns are allowed but will be ignored by Braze.


### How it works

With Braze Cloud Data Ingestion, you set up an integration between your data warehouse instance and Braze app group to sync data on a recurring basis. This sync runs on a schedule you set, and each integration can have a different schedule. Syncs can run as frequently as every 15 minutes or as infrequently as once per month. For customers who need syncs to occur more frequently than 15 minutes, please speak with your customer success manager, or consider using REST API calls for real-time data ingestion.

When a sync runs, Braze will directly connect to your data warehouse instance, retrieve all new data from the specified table, and delete the corresponding user profiles on your Braze dashboard.

Deleting user profiles cannot be undone. It will permanently remove users which may cause discrepancies in your data. Learn more about what happens when you [delete a user profile]({{site.baseurl}}/help/help_articles/api/delete_user/) in our Help documentation.
