# Configuring Reporting

Braze automatically generates a weekly email report to help you understand the performance of your apps and messaging campaigns. You can subscribe to this report on your [Account Settings][2] page by clicking the “Subscribe to Analytics Report” checkbox.

Additionally, if you’re utilizing Custom events, you can select up to 5 key events to be included in your weekly report. The events can be updated at any time on the [Custom Events Management][3] page.
