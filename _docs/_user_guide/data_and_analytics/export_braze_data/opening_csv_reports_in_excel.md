# Opening CSV exports in Excel

## Set Excel as the default program

While CSV files are usually automatically opened in Excel by default, this may not always be the case. Refer to the [Windows][20] and [Apple][21] troubleshooting articles for steps to set Excel as your default program.

## Converting CSV to XLSX or XLS

To convert a CSV to XLSX or XLS, or get rid of the comma between data values, refer to [this guide][19] for importing CSVs into Excel.

## Leading zeroes stripped from user IDs

You may sometimes find that leading zeroes are stripped from user IDs in your CSV export. This happens because Excel treats the numbers in a CSV as data instead of text. To resolve this, run the [Excel Text Import Wizard][22].
