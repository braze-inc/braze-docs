# Opening CSV exports in Excel

## Setting Excel as the default program

While CSV files are usually automatically opened in Excel by default, that is sometimes not the case on Windows 7. Refer to this [troubleshooting article][20] for steps to set Excel as your default program for CSVs on Windows 7.

## Converting CSV to XLSX or XLS

To convert a CSV to XLSX or XLS, or get rid of the comma in between data values, refer to [this guide][19] for importing CSVs into Excel.

## Leading zeroes stripped from user IDs

You may sometimes find that leading zeroes are stripped from User IDs in your CSV export. This happens because Excel treats the numbers in a CSV as data, as opposed to text. To resolve this, run the [Excel Text Import Wizard][22].
