# Revenue data

On the **Revenue** page of the dashboard, you can view data on revenue or purchases over specific periods of time, for a specific product, or your app's total revenue or purchases.

{% alert tip %}
Looking for more ways to get revenue data? Try adding purchase behavior (as well as purchase of a product) to campaigns or Canvases as [conversion events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/building_campaigns/conversion_events/).
{% endalert %}

## Total revenue

You can view revenue statistics on a case-by-case basis on the [Campaign Analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/your_reports/campaign_analytics/) or [Canvas Analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/testing_canvases/measuring_and_testing_with_canvas_analytics/) pages. The Total Revenue statistic is generated from campaign recipients who have made a purchase within the campaign's primary conversion period.

## Direct revenue

You can view the following additional revenue metrics by generating a Campaign Comparison Report using the [Report Builder][1]:

- [Total Direct Revenue][2]
- [Total Direct Purchases][3]
- [Unique Direct Purchases][4]
- [Revenue per Recipient][5]

These metrics are based on last-click attribution, which means that in order for revenue to be attributed to a campaign, that campaign must:

1. Be the last campaign the user clicked prior to purchasing
    <br>**AND**<br>
2. Be clicked by the user less than 3 days prior to purchasing
