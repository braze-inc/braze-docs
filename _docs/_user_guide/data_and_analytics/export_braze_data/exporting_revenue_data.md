## Total Revenue

You can view revenue statistics on a case-by-case basis on the Analytics pages for your campaigns. The Total Revenue statistic is generated from campaign recipients who have made a purchase within the campaign's primary conversion period.

## Direct Revenue

You can view the following additional revenue metrics by generating a Campaign Comparison Report using the [Report Builder][1]:

- [Total Direct Revenue][2]
- [Total Direct Purchases][3]
- [Unique Direct Purchases][4]
- [Revenue per Recipient][5]

These metrics are based on last-click attribution, which means that in order for revenue to be attributed to a campaign, that campaign must:

1. Be the last campaign the user clicked prior to purchasing, and
2. Be clicked by the user less than 3 days prior to purchasing.
