# Export News Feed data

{% alert note %}
News Feed is being deprecated. Braze recommends that customers who use our News Feed tool move over to our Content Cards messaging channel—it's more flexible, customizable, and reliable. Check out the [migration guide]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/migrating_from_news_feed/) for more.
{% endalert %}

When analyzing the performance of a specific News Feed card, you can export the data found in the performance breakdown graphs:

- Impressions by Date
    - Clickthrough Rate
    - Impressions
    - Unique Impressions
- Clicks by Date
    - Clickthrough Rate
    - Clicks
    - Unique Clicks
