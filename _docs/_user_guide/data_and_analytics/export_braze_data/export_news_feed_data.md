# News Feed data

{% alert note %}
News Feed is being deprecated. Braze recommends that customers who use our News Feed tool move over to our Content Cards messaging channelâ€”it's more flexible, customizable, and reliable. Check out the [migration guide]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/migrating_from_news_feed/) for more.
{% endalert %}

When analyzing the performance of a specific News Feed card, you can export the data found in the performance breakdown graphs:

- Impressions by Date
    - Clickthrough Rate
    - Impressions
    - Unique Impressions
- Clicks by Date
    - Clickthrough Rate
    - Clicks
    - Unique Clicks
