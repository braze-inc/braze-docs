# Custom Event Aggregates

The Custom Events page of the Dashboard allows you to view the occurrences of one or more custom events over time. If you view Detailed Statistics for Custom events or Custom events by the hour, you'll have the option of also viewing the data by specific segments.

You can export the following CSVs:

- Custom Events by Date
    - (Optional) Custom Events for Different Segments
- Custom Events by Hour
    - (Optional) Custom Events for Different Segments
- Custom Events per MAU
