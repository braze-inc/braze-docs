### Filtering by date and apps

Select the date range for your revenue report and, if you like, a specific app or selection of apps.

### Filtering by parameters

The **Performance Over Time** graph shows the data for different parameters, which can be selected in the **Statistics for** dropdown. You can optionally breakdown the data of certain parameters in the **Breakdown** dropdown.

You can view the following data in the **Performance Over Time Graph**:
- KPI Formulas
- Purchases
    - (Optional) Purchases By Product
- Revenue
    - (Optional) Revenue By Segment
    - (Optional) Revenue By Product

## Understanding revenue calculations

- *Lifetime revenue* is the total `PurchaseEvents` `price` value (in USD) received since inception. 
- *Lifetime value per user* is the *Lifetime revenue* divided by your total *Users* (located on your **Home** page).
- Average *Daily revenue* is the average of the sum of the campaign and Canvas revenue for a given day.
- *Daily Purchases* is the average of the total unique `PurchaseEvents` over the time period.
- *Daily revenue per user* is the average daily revenue per daily active user.

## Viewing the product breakdown

Refer to the **Product Breakdown** table for a list of the products purchased during your selected date range, how many of each product were purchased, and how much revenue each product generated.
