# Deliverability Center

> The Deliverability Center provides more insight for your email performance by supporting the use of [Gmail Postmaster Tools][1] to track data on emails sent and gather data about your sending domain.

Email deliverability is at the core when it comes to measuring the success of a messaging campaign. Using the Deliverability Center in the Braze dashboard, you can view your domains by **IP Reputation** or **Delivery Errors** to discover and troubleshoot any potential issues with email deliverability. 

{% alert important %}
The Deliverability Center is currently in early access. Contact your Braze customer success manager if you're interested in participating in the early access.
{% endalert %}

## Integrate with Google Postmaster

Before setting up your Deliverability Center, check that your domains have been [added to the Gmail Postmaster Tools][4].

Follow these steps to integrate with Google Postmaster and set up your Deliverability Center:

1. Go to the **Analytics** > **Email Performance**.
2. Select the **Deliverability Center** tab. <br>![][3]
3. Click **Connect with Google Postmaster**. Select your Google Account, and click the **Allow** button to allow Braze to view email traffic metrics for the domains registered with the Postmaster Tools.
4. Your verified domains will display in the Deliverability Center. <br>![][5]

You can also access Google Postmaster in the Braze dashboard by navigating to **Partner Integrations** > **Technology Partners** > **Google Postmaster**. After integrating, Braze pulls reputation and error data for the last 30 days. The data may not be immediately available and could take several minutes to populate.

#### IP reputation

To help understand the ratings for IP reputation, refer to this table:

| Reputation Level | Definition |
| ----- | ---------- |
| High | Has a good track record of generating low spam complaints (i.e., users clicking the "spam" button). |
| Medium/Fair | Known to generate positive engagement, but occasionally receives spam complaints. Most of the emails from this domain will be sent to the inbox, except when spam complaints increase. |
| Low | Known to receive elevated rates of spam complaints regularly. Emails from this sender will likely be filtered to the spam folder. |
| Bad | Has a history of receiving elevated rates of spam complaints. Emails coming from this domain will almost always be rejected at connection time or filtered to the spam folder. |
