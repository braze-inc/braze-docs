# Pre-Populating Custom Data

There may be times where you'd like to start setting up campaigns and segments using custom data before that custom data has been integrated by your development team. Braze allows you to pre-populate custom events and attributes on the dashboard before these pieces of data start tracking, so that these events and attributes are available for use in dropdowns, and as part of the campaign creation process.

To pre-populate custom events and attributes, navigate to the **Manage Settings** page, and then click on the **Custom Attributes** or **Custom Events** tab. Then click on **Add Custom Attributes** or **Add Custom Events** in the upper right corner.

![Navigate to Custom Attributes or Custom Events][21]

You can then enter your custom attribute or event. For custom attributes, you'll need to select what data type this attribute will be (for instance, boolean or string). An attribute's data type will determine what types of segmentation filters are available for that attribute—you can learn more about the different segmentation filter options available [here][20].

![Add new attribute or event][22]

Keep in mind that when your development team integrates these custom events/ attributes later, they will need to name them exactly as you have named them here—including the use of uppercase or lowercase letters—or else Braze will generate a different custom event or attribute.
