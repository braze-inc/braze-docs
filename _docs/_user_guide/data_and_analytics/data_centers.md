# Data centers

> At Braze, data centers provide reliable and efficient engagement between you and your users. Braze data centers allow you to host customer data locally. This way, you can set the standard of best practices in customer data management and engagement by reducing risks related to data control, flexibility, and management.

## How it works

Braze operates several data centers located in different regions around the world. These data centers allow our services to be reliable and scalable. This geographical distribution helps to minimize latency, which is the time it takes for data to travel between the server and the user. 

This also means that when a user interacts with your app or website, their requests are directed to the nearest data center, optimizing performance and reducing load times. By connecting to the nearest data center, your users can experience fast load times, which is especially important for real-time messaging and user engagement.

Let's say you have a mobile app that sends push notifications to users. If a user in Melbourne receives a notification, the request to send that notification is routed to the nearest data center in Australia. In the event the mobile app experiences a surge in users during a promotional event, Braze has a scalable infrastructure with multiple data centers that can handle the increased demand.

## List of data centers

Refer to the following table for a list of available data centers.
