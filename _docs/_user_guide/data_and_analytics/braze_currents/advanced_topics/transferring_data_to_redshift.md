# Transferring Data to Redshift

[Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) is a popular data warehouse that runs on Amazon Web Services alongside Amazon S3. Braze data from Currents is structured to be easy to transfer to Redshift directly.

More information on how to transfer data from Amazon S3 to Redshift via an ETL process are available on Github [here](https://github.com/Appboy/currents-examples).

Please note that this is only one of many options you can choose from when it comes to transferring your data to places that would be most advantageous to you.
