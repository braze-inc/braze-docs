If you can't find what you need in this article, check out our [Customer Behavior Events Library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/customer_behavior_events/) or our [Currents sample data examples](https://github.com/Appboy/currents-examples/tree/master/sample-data).

{% details Explanation of message engagement event structure and platform values %}

### Event structure

This event breakdown shows what type of information is generally included in a message engagement event. With a solid understanding of its components, your developers and business intelligence strategy team can use the incoming Currents event data to make data-driven reports, charts and take advantage of other valuable data metrics.

![Breakdown of a message engagement event showing an email unsubscribe event with the listed properties grouped by user-specific properties, campaign or Canvas tracking properties, and event-specific properties]({% image_buster /assets/img/message_engagement_event.png %})

Message engagement events are comprised of **user-specific** properties, **campaign/canvas tracking** properties, and **event-specific** properties.

### Platform values

Certain events return a `platform` value that specifies the platform of the user's device. 
<br>The following table details the possible returned values:

| User device | Platform value |
| --- | --- |
| iOS | `ios` |
| Android | `android` |
| FireTV | `kindle` |
| Kindle | `kindle` |
| Web | `web` |
| tvOS | `tvos` |
| Roku | `roku` |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

{% alert important %}
These schemas only apply to the flat file event data we send to Data Warehouse partners (Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage). For schemas that apply to the other partners, refer to our list of [available partners]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/available_partners/) and check their respective pages.<br><br>Additionally, note that Currents will drop events with excessively large payloads of greater than 900&nbsp;KB.

#### Property details
- For `ad_id`, `ad_id_type` and `ad_tracking_enabled`, you will need to explicitly collect the iOS IDFA and Android Google ADID through the native SDKs. Learn more about them here: [iOS]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/analytics/swift_idfv/), [Android]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/initial_sdk_setup/optional_gaid_collection/#optional-google-advertising-id).
- If you are using Kafka to ingest [Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/) data, reach out to your customer success manager or account manager to enable the feature flipper for sending `ad_id`.
- `message_extras` allow you to annotate your send events with dynamic data from Connected Content, custom attributes (such as language, country), and Canvas entry properties. Refer to [Message extras]({{site.baseurl}}/message_extras_tag/) to learn more.

Learn more about them here: [iOS]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/analytics/swift_idfv/), [Android]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/initial_sdk_setup/optional_gaid_collection/#optional-google-advertising-id).
- If you are using Kafka to ingest [Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/) data, reach out to your customer success manager or account manager to enable the feature flipper for sending `ad_id`.

## SMS inbound received events

{% apitags %}
SMS, InboundReceived
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when one of your users sends an SMS to a phone number in one of your Braze SMS subscription groups. 

When Braze receives an inbound SMS, we attribute that inbound message to any user that shares that phone number. As a result, you may receive multiple events per inbound message if multiple users in your Braze instance share the same phone number. If you require attribution of specific user IDs based on previous messages sent to that user, you can use the SMS Delivered event to attribute Inbound Received events to the user ID who most recently received a message from your Braze number.

If we detect that this inbound message is a reply to an outbound campaign or Canvas component sent from Braze, we will also include the campaign or Canvas metadata with the event. Braze defines a reply as an inbound message coming within four hours of an outbound message. However, there is a one-minute cache for the attributed campaign information of the last outbound SMS received.

```json
// SMS Inbound Received: users.messages.sms.InboundReceive

## Uninstall events

{% apitags %}
Uninstall
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when a user uninstalls an app. Use this data to track when users uninstall an app. While this is currently a message engagement event, this will be changed to a user behavior event in the future.

{% alert important %}
This event is not fired when the user actually uninstalls the app, as that's impossible to track exactly. Braze sends a daily silent push to determine if the app still exists on your user's device, and if we get an error on that silent push, it is assumed the app has been uninstalled.
{% endalert %}

```json
// Uninstall Event: users.behaviors.Uninstall
{
  "id": (required, string) unique ID of this event,
  "user_id": (required, string) Braze user ID of the user,
  "external_user_id": (optional, string) External ID of the user,
  "device_id": (optional, string) ID of the device on which the session occurred,
  "app_id": (required, string) ID for the app on which the user action occurred,
  "time": (required, int) 10-digit UTC time of the event in seconds since the epoch
}
