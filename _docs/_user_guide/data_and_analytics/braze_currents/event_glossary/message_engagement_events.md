Please contact your Account Manager or [open a support ticket][support] if you need access to additional event entitlements. If you can't find what you need below, check out our [Customer Behavior Events Library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/customer_behavior_events/) or our [Currents sample data examples](https://github.com/Appboy/currents-examples/tree/master/sample-data).

{% details Explanation of Message Engagement Event Structure %}
<br>
This event breakdown shows what type of information is generally included in a message engagement event. With a solid understanding of its components, your developers and business intelligence strategy team can use the incoming Currents event data to make data-driven reports, charts and take advantage of other valuable data metrics.

![image]({% image_buster /assets/img/message_engagement_event.png %})

Message engagement events are comprised of __user specific__ properties, __campaign/canvas tracking__ properties and __event specific__ properties.

{% enddetails %}

{% alert important %}
Please note that these schemas __only apply to the flat file event data we send to Data Warehouse partners (Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage)__. For schema that apply to the other partners, please check [their respective pages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/available_partners/).<br><br>Additionally, note that Currents will drop events with excessively large payloads of greater than 900KB.

## Push Send Events

{% apitags %}
Push, Sends
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when Braze processes a push message for a user, communicating this to Apple Push Notification Service or Fire Cloud Messaging. This does not mean the push was delivered to the device, just that a message was sent.

```json
// Push Notification Send: users.messages.pushnotification.Send
{
  "id": (string) unique id of this event,
  "user_id": (string) Braze user id of the user,
  "external_user_id": (string) External ID of the user,
  "time": (int) 10-digit UTC time of the event in seconds since the epoch,
  "timezone": (string) IANA time zone of the user at the time of the event,
  "app_id": (string) id for the app on which the user action occurred,
  "campaign_id": (string) id of the campaign if from a campaign,

  "message_variation_id": (string) id of the message variation if from a campaign,
  "canvas_id": (string) id of the Canvas if from a Canvas,
  "canvas_name": (string) name of the Canvas,
  "canvas_variation_id": (string) id of the Canvas variation the user is in if from a Canvas,

```
#### Property Details
- For `ad_id`, `ad_id_type` and `ad_tracking_enabled`, you will need to explicitly collect the iOS idfa and Android Google adid through the native SDKs.

## SMS Inbound Received Events

{% apitags %}
SMS, InboundReceived
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when one of your users sends an SMS to a phone number in one of your Braze SMS subscription groups. Note when Braze receives an Inbound SMS, we attribute that inbound message to any user that shares that phone number. As a result, you may receive multiple events per inbound message if multiple users in your Braze instance share the same phone number. If you require attribution of specific user IDs based on previous messages sent to that user, you can use the SMS Delivered event to attribute Inbound Received events to the user ID who most recently received a message from your Braze number.
