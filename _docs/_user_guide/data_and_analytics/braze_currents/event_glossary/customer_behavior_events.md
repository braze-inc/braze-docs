Contact your Braze representative or open a [support ticket]({{site.baseurl}}/braze_support/) if you need access to additional event entitlements. If you can't find what you need in this article, check out our [Message Engagement Events Library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/message_engagement_events/) or our [Currents sample data examples](https://github.com/Appboy/currents-examples/tree/master/sample-data).

{% details Explanation of customer behavior and user event structure and platform values %}

### Event structure 

This customer behavior and user events breakdown shows what type of information is generally included in a customer behavior or user event. With a solid understanding of its components, your developers and business intelligence strategy team can use the incoming Currents event data to make data-driven reports, charts and take advantage of other valuable data metrics. 

![Breakdown of a user event showing a purchase event with the listed properties grouped by user-specific properties, behavior-specific properties, and device-specific properties]({% image_buster /assets/img/customer_engagement_event.png %})

Customer behavior and user events are comprised of **user-specific** properties, **behavior-specific** properties, and **device-specific** properties. 

### Platform values

Certain events return a `platform` value that specifies the platform of the user's device. 
<br>The following table details the possible returned values:

| User device | Platform value |
| --- | --- |
| iOS | `ios` |
| Android | `android` |
| FireTV | `kindle` |
| Kindle | `kindle` |
| Web | `web` |
| tvOS | `tvos` |
| Roku | `roku` |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

{% enddetails %}

{% alert important %}
Note that these schemas only apply to the flat file event data we send to Data Warehouse partners (Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage), and are not available for Segment.io connectors. For schema that apply to other partners, refer to our list of [available partners]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/available_partners/) and check their respective pages.<br><br>Additionally, note that Currents will drop events with excessively large payloads of greater than 900&nbsp;KB.

## Custom events

{% apitags %}
Custom Events
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when a specific custom event is triggered. Use this to track when users perform custom events in your application.

```json
// Custom Event: users.behaviors.CustomEvent
{
  "id": (required, string) unique id of this event,
  "user_id": (required, string) Braze user id of the user,
  "external_user_id": (optional, string) External ID of the user,
  "app_id": (optional, string) id for the app on which the user action occurred,
  "time": (required, int) 10-digit UTC time of the event in seconds since the epoch,
  "timezone": (optional, string) IANA time zone of the user at the time of the event,
  "platform": (optional, string) platform of the device (one of 'ios', 'android', 'web', 'kindle', 'tvos', OR 'roku'),
  "os_version": (optional, string) os version of device used for the action,
  "device_model": (optional, string) hardware model of the device,
  "device_id": (optional, string) id of the device on which the event occurred,
  "name": (required, string) name of the custom event,
  "properties": (required, string) JSON encoded string of the properties for this event,
  "ad_id": (optional, string) advertising identifier,
  "ad_id_type": (optional, string) One of 'ios_idfa', 'google_ad_id', OR 'roku_ad_id',
  "ad_tracking_enabled": (optional, boolean) whether advertising tracking is enabled for the device
}
```

#### Property details
- For `ad_id`, `ad_id_type` and `ad_tracking_enabled`, you will need to explicitly collect the iOS idfa and Android Google adid through the native SDKs. Learn more about them here: [iOS]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/analytics/swift_idfv/), [Android]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/initial_sdk_setup/optional_gaid_collection/#optional-google-advertising-id).
- If you are using Kafka to ingest [Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/) data, reach out to your customer success manager or account manager to enable the feature flipper for sending `ad_id`.
