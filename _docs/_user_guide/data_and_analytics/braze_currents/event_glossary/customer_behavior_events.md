Please contact your Braze representative or [open a support ticket][support] if you need access to additional event entitlements. If you can't find what you need below, check out our [Message Engagement Events Library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/message_engagement_events/) or our [Currents sample data examples](https://github.com/Appboy/currents-examples/tree/master/sample-data).

{% details Explanation of Customer Behavior and User Event Structure %}
<br>
This Customer Behavior and User Events breakdown shows what type of information is generally included in a customer behavior or user event. With a solid understanding of its components, your developers and business intelligence strategy team can use the incoming Currents event data to make data-driven reports, charts and take advantage of other valuable data metrics. 

![image]({% image_buster /assets/img/customer_engagement_event.png %})

Customer Behavior and User Events events are comprised of __user specific__ properties, __behavior specific__ properties, and __device specific__ properties. 

{% enddetails %}

{% alert important %}
Please note that these schemas __only apply to the flat file event data we send to Data Warehouse partners (Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage)__. For schema that apply to the other partners, please check [their respective pages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/available_partners/).<br><br>Additionally, note that Currents will drop events with excessively large payloads of greater than 900KB.

## Custom Events

{% apitags %}
Custom Events
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when a specific custom event is triggered. Use this to track when users perform custom events in your application.

```json
// Custom Event: users.behaviors.CustomEvent
{
  "id": (string) unique id of this event,
  "user_id": (string) Braze user id of the user,
  "external_user_id": (string) External ID of the user,
  "time": (int) 10-digit UTC time of the event in seconds since the epoch,
  "timezone": (string) IANA time zone of the user at the time of the event,
  "name": (string) name of the custom event,
  "app_id": (string) id for the app on which the user action occurred,
  "platform": (string) platform of the device (iOS, Android, web, etc.),
  "os_version": (string) os version of device used for the action,
  "device_model": (string) hardware model of the device,
  "device_id": (string) id of the device on which the event occurred,
  "properties": (string) JSON encoded string of the properties for this event,
  "ad_id": (string) advertising identifier,
  "ad_id_type": (string) One of 'ios_idfa', 'google_ad_id', 'windows_ad_id', OR 'roku_ad_id',
  "ad_tracking_enabled": (boolean) whether advertising tracking is enabled for the device
}
```

#### Property Details
- For `ad_id`, `ad_id_type` and `ad_tracking_enabled`, you will need to explicitly collect the iOS idfa and Android Google adid through the native SDKs. Learn more about them here: [iOS]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/initial_sdk_setup/optional_idfa_collection/#optional-idfa-collection/), [Android]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/initial_sdk_setup/optional_gaid_collection/#optional-google-advertising-id).
- If you are using Kafka to ingest [Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/) data, reach out to your Customer Success Manager or Account Manager to enable the feature flipper for sending `ad_id`.

## News Feed Impression Event

{% apitags %}

{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when the user views the entire News Feed, not a specific News Feed Card. Use this to track users viewing the News Feed.

{% alert tip %}
We do track other News Feed events; these are located in [Message Engagement Events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/message_engagement_events/).
{% endalert %}

```json
// News Feed Impression: users.behaviors.app.NewsFeedImpression
{
  "id": (string) unique id of this event,
  "user_id": (string) Braze user id of the user,
  "external_user_id": (string) External ID of the user,

## Uninstall Events

{% apitags %}
Uninstall
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when a user uninstalls an app. Use this data to track when users uninstall an app.

{% alert important %}
Please note that this is not fired when the user actually uninstalls the app - that's impossible to track exactly. Braze sends a daily silent push to determine if the app still exists on your user's device, and if we get an error on that silent push, it is assumed the app has been uninstalled.
{% endalert %}

```json
// Uninstall Event: users.behaviors.Uninstall
{
  "id": (string) unique id of this event,
  "user_id": (string) Braze user id of the user,
  "external_user_id": (string) External ID of the user,
  "time": (int) 10-digit UTC time of the event in seconds since the epoch,
  "app_id": (string) id for the app on which the user action occurred,
  "device_id": (string) id of the device on which the session occurred
}
```

{% endapi %}

{% api %}

## Attribution Events

{% apitags %}
Attribution
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when an app installation is attributed to a source. Use this to track where your app installs are coming from.

```json
// Install Attribution Event: users.behaviors.InstallAttribution
{
  "id": (string) unique id of this event,
  "user_id": (string) Braze user id of the user,
  "external_user_id": (string) External ID of the user,
  "time": (int) 10-digit UTC time of the event in seconds since the epoch,
  "source": (string) the source of the attribution
}
```

{% endapi %}

{% api %}

## Random Bucket Number Event

{% apitags %}
Random Bucket Number
{% endapitags %}

This user event occurs every time a new user is created within their app group. During this event, each new user gets assigned a random bucket number that you can then use to create uniformly distributed segments of random users. Use this to group a range of random bucket number values and compare performance across your campaigns and campaign variants. 

```json
// Random Bucket Number Event: users.RandomBucketNumberUpdate
{
  "id": (string) unique id of this event,
  "app_group_id": (string) AppGroup API id
  "user_id": (string) Braze user id of the user,
  "external_user_id": (string) External ID of the user,
  "time": (int) UTC time of the event in milliseconds since the epoch,
  "random_bucket_number": (int) new random bucket number
  "prev_random_bucket_number":  (int) old random bucket number, optional
}
```

{% alert important %}
Note that this Currents event is only available for customers that have purchased an "all events connector" and is only available for storage event connectors (i.e Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Storage).
<br><br>To get this event enabled and to schedule the backfill for existing users' random bucket numbers in your app group, contact your Customer Success Manager.
