# Custom SQL in query builder

With the query builder, you can generate reports using Braze data in Snowflake, now using custom SQL to unlock new insights.

The SQL editor is in early access. If you're interested in participating in the early access, reach out to your customer success manager.
{% endalert %}

## Creating custom SQL reports

To run a report:

1. Go to **Query Builder**, under **Data**.
2. Select the **Query Templates** tab and select **Custom**.
3. Write your SQL query in the editor. See [Writing SQL](#writing-sql) for requirements and resources.
4. Click **Run Query**.
5. To download a CSV of your report, click **Export**.

## Data and results

Results, and exports of results, are tables that can contain up to 500 rows. For reports that require larger amounts of data, use another tool such as [Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents) or Brazeâ€™s [export APIs]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/export).

## Writing SQL

Your SQL query should be written using [Snowflake syntax](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference). Consult the [table reference]({{site.baseurl}}/sql_segments_tables/) for a full list of tables and columns available to be queried.

To view table details within the query builder:

1. From the **Query Builder** page, make sure your **Query Template** is set to **Custom**.
2. Select the **Available Data Tables** tab to view available data tables and their names.
3. Click <i class="fas fa-chevron-down" alt=""></i> **See Details** to view the table description and information about the table columns, such as data types.
4. To insert the table name in your SQL, click <i class="fas fa-copy" title="Copy table name to SQL editor"></i>.

Restricting your query to a specific time period will help you generate results quicker. The following is an example query that gets the number of purchases and the revenue generated for the last hour.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as Purchases, SUM(price) as Revenue
FROM USERS_BEHAVIORS_PURCHASE_SHARED
WHERE to_date(to_timestamp_ntz(time)) >= DATEADD('hour', -1, date_trunc('day',CURRENT_DATE()));
```

This query retrieves the number of email sends in the last month:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as Sends
FROM USERS_MESSAGES_EMAIL_SEND_SHARED
WHERE to_date(to_timestamp_ntz(time)) >= DATEADD('month', -1, date_trunc('day',CURRENT_DATE()));
```

## Troubleshooting

Your query may fail for any of the following reasons:

- Syntax errors in your SQL query
- Processing timeout (after 6 minutes)
    - Reports that take longer than 6 minutes to run will time out.
    - If a report times out, try to limit the time range in which you are querying data or query a more specific set of data.
