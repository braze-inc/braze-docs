# Brand guidelines for AI copywriting assistant

> Tailor the style of your AI-generated copy to match your brand’s voice and personality with customized brand guidelines.

## Creating brand guidelines {#steps}

Follow these steps to create brand guidelines in the AI copywriting assistant. You can also create brand guidelines on the [Brand Guidelines]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/brand_guidelines/) settings page.

### Step 1: Create a brand guideline

1. From your message composer, select <i class="fa-solid fa-wand-magic-sparkles"></i> **Launch AI Copywriter**.
   * In the drag-and-drop editor for in-app messages, select a text block and select <i class="fa-solid fa-wand-magic-sparkles" title="AI Copywriter"></i> in the block's toolbar.
2. Select **Apply brand guideline** and then **Create a brand guideline**.
3. Enter a name for this guideline. It will be the label you see in the previous selection.
4. For **When will you use these brand guidelines?**, add details to help your colleagues (and future you) understand the context for using this guideline.
5. If you want this to be the default brand guideline for the current workspace, check **Use as default brand guideline**.

### Step 2: Describe your brand personality

For **Brand personality**, think about what makes your brand unique. Include traits, values, voice, and any archetypes that define your brand. Here are some characteristics to consider:

| **Characteristic**       | **Definition**                                                                       | **Example**                                                        |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reputation               | How you want your brand to be perceived in the market.                               | We are known for being the most reliable and customer-focused brand in our industry. |
| Personality traits       | Human-like characteristics that describe your brand’s character.                     | Our brand is friendly, approachable, and always upbeat.          |
| Values                   | Core values that guide your brand’s actions and decisions.                           | We value sustainability, transparency, and community.            |
| Differentiation          | Unique qualities that set your brand apart from competitors.                         | We stand out by offering personalized customer service that goes above and beyond. |
| Brand voice              | The tone and style of communication your brand uses.                                 | Our voice is casual yet informative, ensuring clarity without being too formal. |
| Brand archetype          | The archetype that represents your brand’s persona (The Hero, The Creator, and so on).    | We embody the ‘Explorer’ archetype, always seeking new challenges and adventures. |

### Step 3: Define language that should be avoided (optional)

For **Exclusions**, list any language or style that doesn’t align with your brand. For example, you might want to avoid "sarcasm," "negative attitudes," or "condescending" tones.

### Step 4: Test your guidelines

Test your guidelines to see how they perform. Expand **Test your guidelines** to generate example copy and adjust as needed.

### Step 5: Save your guidelines

When you're happy with your guidelines, select **Save brand guideline**. Your new guidelines will be saved in your workspace for future use.

{% alert important %}
You can change the output language regardless of what language your copy is in, but neither Braze nor OpenAI guarantee the quality of translation. Always test and verify translations before using them.

## Editing guidelines

To edit your existing brand guidelines:

1. Open the AI copywriting assistant.
2. Apply the brand guidelines you want to change. A button will appear near the field.
3. Select **Edit guideline**.

## How is my data used and sent to OpenAI?

In order to generate copy using a brand guideline, Braze will send your query including the content of your guideline to OpenAI. All queries sent to OpenAI from Braze are anonymized, meaning that OpenAI will not be able to identify from whom the query was sent unless you include uniquely identifiable information in the input you provide or in your past campaign data when enabling the option labeled "Reference past campaign data". Per [OpenAI’s policy](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies), data sent to OpenAI’s API via Braze is not used to train or improve their models and will be deleted after 30 days. Between you and Braze, any content generated using GPT is your intellectual property. Braze will not assert any claims of copyright ownership on such content and makes no warranty of any kind with respect to any AI-generated content.
