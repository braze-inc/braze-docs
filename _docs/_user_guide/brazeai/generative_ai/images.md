# Generating images with BrazeAI<sup>TM</sup>

## About the media library

The media library allows you to manage your assets in a single, centralized location. To access your Braze media library, go to THIS > **Templates**. For more detailed information, see [Media library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/media_library/).

## Generating an image

1. Go to your media library, then select <i class="fas fa-wand-magic-sparkles"></i> **AI Image Generator**.
2. Enter a description of the image you want to generate, up to 300 characters. The more detailed the description, the better your result. This feature only supports text input—uploading an image as a reference isn’t available.
3. Select **Generate Images**. It can take about a minute for images to generate.
4. Select <i class="fas fa-download" title="Add image to Media Library"></i> on the images you would like to add to your media library.
