## Best practices

Consider the following, so you can make the most of Content QA with AI:

- **Proofread your message:** Although the content checker can help identify errors, it is still essential to proofread your content manually. Rely on the AI-generated suggestions as a helpful guide, but use your judgment to ensure accuracy.
- **Understand the tone analysis:** The tone analysis results are subjective and based on the AI model's understanding. While they can provide useful insights, consider your intended tone and the conversation context to make appropriate adjustments.
- **Double-check flagged offensive language:** Offensive language detection is designed to be robust, but it may occasionally flag false positives. Review flagged sections carefully and make appropriate changes as necessary.
