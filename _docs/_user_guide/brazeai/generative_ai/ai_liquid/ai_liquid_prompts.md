# About prompting the BrazeAI<sup>TM</sup> Liquid Assistant

> Prompting is the process of giving the BrazeAI<sup>TM</sup> Liquid Assistant clear instructions on what you want it to do.

The BrazeAI<sup>TM</sup> Liquid Assistant is designed to function as a best-in-class marketer who's an expert at using Braze and Liquid to create impactful marketing messages, but it still requires guidance on your particular use cases or questions.

There is no single correct way to prompt the assistant, and you can always add further details to your prompts during your conversation. This means you don't need to spend a lot of time crafting the "perfect" initial prompt. However, you can get the most out of the assistant by following some best practices.

## Best practices for effective prompting

### Use natural language

The BrazeAI<sup>TM</sup> Liquid Assistant is trained to understand natural language. Chat with it as you would with a coworker when asking for help. This makes it easier for the assistant to comprehend your needs and provide accurate assistance.

### Give context

Providing context helps the BrazeAI<sup>TM</sup> Liquid Assistant understand the bigger picture surrounding your project. It's helpful to include context such as:

- Your company name and industry
- A campaign you're working on, such as Black Friday or holiday sales
- Your goal, such as increasing your click-through rate
- Specific custom attributes you want to include in your message

Including context in your prompt helps the assistant tailor its responses to better suit your needs. You can also include details from your campaign, message brief, or brainstorming document to bring the assistant up to speed.

### Be specific

The BrazeAI<sup>TM</sup> Liquid Assistant can ask follow-up questions, but providing details upfront can lead to more precise results sooner. Consider including details such as:

- Any known preferences or requirements for the message
- Instructions on how to handle situations, such as a lack of responses from the message recipient or fallback message options
- When asking for Liquid that uses Connected Content, documentation for the API endpoint, a sample API response, or both

### Get creative

Think outside the box with your prompts to see how the BrazeAI<sup>TM</sup> Liquid Assistant can enhance your messaging. Experiment with different prompts and ideas, as creativity can lead to more engaging results.

## Example prompts

### General information

- What is Liquid, and how can it help me enhance the personalization of my marketing campaigns within Braze?
- What types of data can I use in Liquid to personalize my marketing messages, such as demographic information or past purchases?

### Personalization and dynamic content

- Create a message that shows different content based on my customer’s loyalty status. If we don’t know about their loyalty status, send a fallback message.
- Write a dynamic message that includes a user’s favorite product and their last purchase date. If there’s no last purchase, abort the message.
- Write me Liquid to encourage someone to click my message that includes a countdown with how much time is left. If the offer has expired, abort the message.
- Help me write a message to encourage users to come back and check out if they have items remaining in their cart.
- Write Liquid to personalize a message based on a customer’s country. I want to fill in the message with the country’s name. If we don’t have either of them, suggest they click on a link to update their profile.
- How can I personalize a welcome message with a user’s first name and write different copy based on the user’s gender?
- Write Liquid to display different messages based on a custom attribute, “CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE_NAME“ and its value. There are six different options I could send. If there’s no value for the custom attribute, I want to send a placeholder message.

### Specific use cases
