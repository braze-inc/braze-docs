## Generating brand guidelines {#steps}

Follow these steps to create brand guidelines in the AI copywriting assistant. You can also create brand guidelines on the [Brand Guidelines]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/brand_guidelines/) settings page.

### Step 1: Create a brand guideline

1. From your message composer, find and select <i class="fa-solid fa-wand-magic-sparkles" title="AI Copywriter"></i> to [open the AI copywriting assistant]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/generative_ai/ai_copywriting/#access).
2. Select **Apply brand guideline** and then **Create a brand guideline**.

![Dropdown for "Apply brand guidelines" expanded with the button "Create a brand guideline" in focus.]({% image_buster /assets/img/ai_copywriter/create_brand_guideline_button.png %}){:style="max-width:75%"}

{: start="3"}

3. Enter a name for this guideline. It will be the label you see in the previous selection.
4. For **When will you use these brand guidelines?**, add details to help your colleagues (and future you) understand the context for using this guideline.
5. If you want this to be the default brand guideline for the current workspace, check **Use as default brand guideline**.

### Step 2: Describe your brand personality

For **Brand personality**, think about what makes your brand unique. Include traits, values, voice, and any archetypes that define your brand. Here are some characteristics to consider:

| **Characteristic**       | **Definition**                                                                       | **Example**                                                        |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reputation               | How you want your brand to be perceived in the market.                               | We are known for being the most reliable and customer-focused brand in our industry. |
| Personality traits       | Human-like characteristics that describe your brand’s character.                     | Our brand is friendly, approachable, and always upbeat.          |
| Values                   | Core values that guide your brand’s actions and decisions.                           | We value sustainability, transparency, and community.            |
| Differentiation          | Unique qualities that set your brand apart from competitors.                         | We stand out by offering personalized customer service that goes above and beyond. |
| Brand voice              | The tone and style of communication your brand uses.                                 | Our voice is casual yet informative, ensuring clarity without being too formal. |
| Brand archetype          | The archetype that represents your brand’s persona (The Hero, The Creator, and so on).    | We embody the ‘Explorer’ archetype, always seeking new challenges and adventures. |

### Step 3: Define language that should be avoided (optional)

For **Exclusions**, list any language or style that doesn’t align with your brand. For example, you might want to avoid "sarcasm," "negative attitudes," or "condescending" tones.

### Step 4: Test your guidelines

Test your guidelines to see how they perform. Expand **Test your guidelines** to generate example copy and adjust as needed.
