# The Intelligence Suite

> The Braze Intelligence Suite helps you automate decision-making with data-based insights. From delivery time to multivariate testing, brands can use these tools and features to create dynamic, cross-channel experiences that optimize at scale. The Intelligence Suite comprises of three main features: Intelligent Timing, Intelligent Channel, and Intelligent Selection.

## Use cases

The Intelligence Suite provides powerful features to analyze user history and campaign and Canvas performance, then make automatic adjustments to increase engagement, viewership, and conversions. For a few examples of how these features can benefit different industries, see the below use cases.

### eCommerce

- **Flash sales:** Use the [Intelligent Channel filter]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/intelligence/intelligent_channel/) to study user history to identify the users who are more responsive to push notifications versus emails, then send push notifications and emails to the respective users. Optionally, select a specific channel for users who don't have enough data to determine their preferred channel.
- **Promotional banners:** Use [Intelligent Selection]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/intelligence/intelligent_selection/) to analyze the performance of different promotional banners in a recurring campaign, then automatically select and send the banner that generates the highest click-through rates.

### Travel

- **Package offers:** Use Intelligent Selection to test different travel package offers in a recurring Canvas and gradually shift Canvas traffic to the best-performing variant to drive higher booking rates.
- **Travel deals:** Use the Intelligent Channel filter to send personalized travel deals through a user's most active channel, such as email or SMS, maximizing the likelihood of them engaging with your messaging.

### Entertainment

- **New content promotion:** Use [Intelligent Timing]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/intelligence/intelligent_timing/) to send notifications about new movies, shows, music, and other types of content when users are most likely to open your messaging.
- **In-game purchases:** Use Intelligent Selection to test different promotional messages for in-game purchases and automatically select the one that generates the highest conversion rates.
