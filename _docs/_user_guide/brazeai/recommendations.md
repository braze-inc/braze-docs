# Item recommendations

> Step up your recommendation game with Braze by creating a recommendation engine that can suggest items and content to your users that they actually want. From customizing experiences with AI to building your own engines with Liquid or Connected Content, you'll find everything you need to make every recommendation count.

## Prerequisites

Before you can create or use item recommendations in Braze, you'll need to [create at least one catalog]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/activation/catalogs/catalog/)&#8212;only items from that catalog will be recommended to users.

## Types and use cases

### AI Personalized {#ai}

As part of the [AI item recommendations]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/recommendations/creating_recommendations/ai/) feature, AI Personalized recommendations take advantage of deep learning to predict what your users are most likely to be interested in next based on what they’ve shown interest in in the past. This method provides a dynamic and tailored recommendation system that adapts to user behavior.

AI Personalized recommendations use the last 6 months of item interaction data, like purchases or custom events, to build the recommendation model. For users without enough data for a personalized list, the most popular items serve as a fallback so your users are still getting relevant suggestions.

With AI item recommendations, you can also further filter the items available with 
[selections]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/activation/catalogs/selections/). However, selections with Liquid cannot be used in AI recommendations, so keep that in mind when building your catalog selections.

{% alert tip %}
AI Personalized recommendations work best with hundreds or thousands of items and typically at least 30,000 users with purchase or interaction data. This is only a rough guide and can vary. The other recommendation types can work with less data.
{% endalert %}

#### Use cases

Based on the interaction data being tracked, use cases for this model could include:

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Most likely to purchase next %}
Predict and recommend the items a user is most likely to purchase next, based on purchase events or custom events related to purchases. For example:

- A travel site could suggest vacation packages, flights, or hotel stays based on a user's browsing history and previous bookings, anticipating their next travel destination and making it easier for them to plan their trip.
- A streaming platform can analyze viewing habits to recommend shows or movies a user is most likely to watch next, keeping them engaged and reducing churn rates.

{% details Requirements %}
- AI item recommendations
- Catalog of relevant items
- A method for tracking purchases, either a purchase object or custom event
{% enddetails %}

### Most popular item {#most-popular}

The "Most popular" recommendation model features items that users engage with most.

#### Use cases

Based on the interaction data being tracked, use cases for this model could include recommending:

{% tabs local %}
{% tab most popular %}
Encourage users to explore popular items in your catalog based on purchases. To make sure you’re only surfacing relevant content, we recommend filtering with a selection.

### Most recent item {#most-recent}

The "Most recent" recommendation model features items that users engage with most. Use this model to reduce churn by encouraging lapsing users to re-engage with relevant content.

#### Use cases

Based on the interaction data being tracked, use cases for this model could include recommending:

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Recently clicked %}
Encourage users to revisit items that they’ve recently clicked on, based on a custom event for clicks.

Promote items that users have recently interacted with, including views, clicks, or purchases. This approach keeps your recommendations fresh and aligned with the user's latest interests​. For example:

- **Education:** An online education platform could encourage users who have recently watched an educational video but haven't enrolled in a course to check out similar courses or subjects of interest to keep the user engaged and motivated to start learning.
- **Fitness:** A fitness app can suggest workouts or challenges that are similar to the ones a user has recently completed or interacted with, keeping their exercise routine varied and engaging.

{% endtabs %}

### Trending item {#trending}

The "Trending" recommendation model features items that had the most positive momentum when it comes to recent user interactions. 

Unlike the "Most Popular" model, which features items with consistently high interaction, this model features items that have experienced an uptick in interactions. You can use it to recommend products that are up-and-coming, and currently seeing increased traction.

#### Use cases

Based on the interaction data being tracked, use cases for this model could include recommending:

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Trending purchased %}
Highlight items that your users have recently purchased with increased frequency. For example, an eCommerce business could recommend seasonal items that users are starting to stock up on during their preparations for the next season. 

{% details Requirements %}
- AI item recommendations
- Catalog of relevant items
- A method for tracking purchases (either a purchase object or custom event)
{% enddetails %}

{% details Setting it up %}
1. Create an [AI item recommendation]({{site.baseurl}}/ai_item_recommendations/).
2. Set the **Type** to **Trending**.
3. Select your catalog.
4. (Optional) Add a selection to filter your recommendation to only relevant items.
5. Choose either a purchase event or a custom event that tracks purchases, along with the corresponding property.
6. Train the recommendation.
7. [Use the recommendation in messaging.]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/sage_ai/recommendations/ai_item_recommendations/#using-recommendations-in-messaging)
{% enddetails %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab Trending liked %}
Highlight items that your users have recently liked with increased frequency. For example, a music app could feature up-and-coming artists who have experienced a recent surge in user likes.

{% details Requirements %}
- AI item recommendations
- Catalog of relevant items
- Custom event for tracking likes
{% enddetails %}

{% details Setting it up %}
1. Create an [AI item recommendation]({{site.baseurl}}/ai_item_recommendations/).
2. Set the **Type** to **Trending**.
3. Select your catalog.
4. (Optional) Add a selection to filter your recommendation to only relevant items.
5. Choose your custom event for tracking likes, along with the corresponding property.
6. Train the recommendation.
7. [Use the recommendation in messaging.]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/sage_ai/recommendations/ai_item_recommendations/#using-recommendations-in-messaging/)
{% enddetails %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Selections-based {#selections-based}

[Selections]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/activation/catalogs/selections/) are specific groups of catalog data. When you use a selection, you're essentially setting up custom filters based on specific columns in your catalog. This could include filters for brand, size, location, date added, and more. It gives you control over what you’re recommending by allowing you to define criteria that items must meet to be shown to users.

The previous three types all involve setting up and training a recommendation model in Braze. While you can use selections in those models as well, you can also accomplish some recommendation use cases with just catalog selections and Liquid personalization.

#### Use cases

Based on the interaction data being tracked, use cases for this model could include recommending:

{% tabs local %}
{% tab New items %}
This scenario doesn't rely directly on user actions but rather on catalog data. You can filter for new items based on their addition date to the catalog and promote these through targeted campaigns or Canvases without needing to train a recommendation model.

For example, a tech eCommerce platform could alert tech enthusiasts about the latest gadgets or upcoming pre-orders, using filters to target items that have been recently added to the catalog.

{% details Requirements %}
- Catalog of relevant items with a field for date added
{% enddetails %}

{% details Setting it up %}
1. Create a selection based on your catalog. Make sure your catalog has a time field (field with a **Data type** set to **Time**) that corresponds to the date the item was added.
2. (Optional) Add any filters if desired.
3. Make sure **Randomize Sort Order** is turned off.
4. For **Sort Field**, select your date added field.
5. Set **Sort Order** to descending.
6. [Use the selection in messaging]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/activation/catalogs/selections/#using-selections-in-messaging).
{% enddetails %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab Random items %}
For a diverse user experience, recommending random items can introduce variety and potentially spark interest in less-visited catalog areas. This method doesn't require specific models or events but rather uses a catalog selection to ensure items are displayed randomly.

For example, an online bookstore could offer a "Surprise Me" feature, recommending a random book based on the user's past purchases or browsing habits, encouraging exploration outside of their normal reading genres.

{% details Requirements %}
- Catalog of relevant items
- Selection with **Randomize Sort Order** turned on
{% enddetails %}

{% details Setting it up %}
1. [Create a selection]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/activation/catalogs/selections/#creating-a-selection) based on your catalog.
2. (Optional) Add any filters if desired.
3. Turn on **Randomize Sort Order**.
4. [Use the selection in messaging]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/activation/catalogs/selections/#using-selections-in-messaging).
{% enddetails %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Rules-based {#rules-based}

A [rules-based recommendation]({{site.baseurl}}/rules_based_recommendations/) engine uses user data and product information to suggest relevant items to users within messages. It uses Liquid and either Braze catalogs or Connected Content to dynamically personalize content based on user behavior and attributes.

Rules-based recommendations are based on fixed logic that you must manually set. This means your recommendations won’t adjust to a user's individual purchase history and tastes unless you update the logic, therefore this method is best for recommendations that don’t need frequent updates.

#### Use cases

Based on the interaction data being tracked, use cases for this model could include:

- **Restock reminders:** Sending restock reminders for items with a predictable usage cycle, like monthly vitamins or weekly groceries, based on their last purchase date.
- **First-time buyers:** Recommend starter kits or introductory offers to first-time buyers to encourage a second purchase.
Loyalty programs: Highlight products that would maximize a customer’s loyalty points or rewards based on their current points balance.
- **Educational content:** Suggest new courses or content based on the topics of previously consumed or purchased materials.
