# BrazeAI Decisioning Studio™ Go


Decisioning Studio currently offers two tiers: Go and Pro. Go includes self-serve creative configuration with a limited action bank, only optimizes on clicks, and is only compatible with the following three Customer Engagement Platforms (CEP's): Braze, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, and Klaviyo.

Each of these tutorials provides steps that need to be completed outside of Go's interface in order for Go to be able to orchestrate via the Customer Engagement Platform of choice.
