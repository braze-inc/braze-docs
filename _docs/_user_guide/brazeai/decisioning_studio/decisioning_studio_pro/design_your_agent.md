# Design your agent

> During the Sales process and initial agent configuration, the first step is working with our AI Decisioning Services team to design your agent.

During the Sales process and initial agent configuration, the first step is working with our AI Decisioning Services team to design your agent.

This includes making the following decisions:

1. **Success metric:** What will the agent maximize when personalizing customer engagement? (e.g., revenue, LTM)
2. **Audience:** For whom will the Decisioning Studio agent make customer engagement decisions?
3. **Experiment groups:** How should Decisioning Studios' randomized controlled trials be structured?
4. **Dimensions:** What decisions should the agent personalize? These could include time of day, subject line, frequency, offers, and more (the possibilities are vast!)
5. **Options:** What options does the agent have to work with? For example, what email templates or offers can it send, and to whom?
6. **Constraints:** What decisions should the agent *never* make?

Each of these decisions has implications for how much incremental uplift the agent may be able to generate, and how quickly. Our AI Decisioning Services team will work with you to design an agent that generates maximum value while respecting all of your business rules.

Once these decisions are made, and we have an architecture diagram for our integration, we can proceed to configuration.
