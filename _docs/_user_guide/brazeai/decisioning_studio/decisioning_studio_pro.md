# Setting up Decisioning Studio Pro agents

> Think of a Decisioning Studio agent like the brain of your Martech stack:  using your rich customer data, the agent orchestrates optimal and personalized decisions at a 1:1 level to maximize a target metric you choose.

AI Decisioning Pro is more flexible and more powerful than AI Decisioning Go. Setting up a Pro agent requires collaboration with our AI Decisioning Services team, which guides and assists with agent design throughout to drive maximum value for your business.

To set up an AI Decisioning Agent and complete the AI Decisioning Loop, at a high level, you will:

#### 1. Design your agent

You will make important decisions such as what metric the agent should optimize for, as well as defining the universe of possible decisions the agent could make.

#### 2. Set customer context

You will connect rich first-party data sources that describe your customer for the Decisioning Agent to learn from.

#### 3. Configure orchestration

You will connect Braze or a non-Braze Marketing Automation Platform that will carry out the Agent's decisions into action

#### 4. Close the AI Decisioning Loop

Finally, you will close the AI Decisioning Loop by connecting data sources that tell the Agent how a customer reacts to its decisions.

Decisioning Studio Pro includes AI Decisioning Services support from Braze’s forward deployed data science team, which will help you design and configure your agent to maximize your business outcomes.

## Best practices

A few best practices for setting up Decisioning Studio agents:

1. The more information agents have about your customers, the better they will perform. 
2. The more diverse the set of actions the agent can take, the more it can personalize its strategy for each user.
3. The fewer constraints on your agents, the better. Constraints should be designed to respect business rules while freeing agent-led experimentation as much as possible.
