# Setting up Decisioning Studio Pro agents

> Think of a Decisioning Studio agent like the brain of your Martech stack. In order to make optimal and personalized decisions at a 1:1 level to maximize a target metric, it needs customer context, a bank of possible actions to select, and the ability to orchestrate marketing communications.

AI Decisioning Services (Braze's forward-deployed engineering team) will configure the agent itself and most integration points, and guide your team on required integration and setup steps on your side.

The first step is to design your agents with assistance from our expert services. This will include mapping out all of the available data, determining an overall orchestration pattern, and setting up the agents for maximal success for your business, including configuring target metrics and appropriate constraints.

## Best practices

A few best practices for setting up Decisioning Studio agents:

1. The more information agents have about your customers, the better they will perform
2. The fewer constraints on your agents, the better. Constraints should be designed to respect business rules while freeing agent-led experimentation as much as possible.

## Setup steps

Once the agent has been designed, the following additional steps need to be taken to set up the self-learning cycle:

1. Configure customer context for the agent, including:
   - Define the audience
   - Feed customer data to the agent
2. Set up Orchestration
3. Create the Feedback loop
