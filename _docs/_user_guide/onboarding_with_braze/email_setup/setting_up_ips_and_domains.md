# Setting up IPs and domains

{% include video.html id="iTm3yQkJ0UU" align="right"  %}

> This article will walk you through the requirements and steps needed to set up your IP addresses and pools, as well as domains and subdomains needed before you can begin sending emails with Braze.<br><br>Though most of the setup process is done by Braze, we have outlined the requirements and materials for this setup.

## Step 1: Outline information

Send the following information to your Braze representative:

* Your chosen domains and subdomains.
* The approximate number of emails you'll be sending each month, this will help us determine how many IPs you'll need.
* Whether you'll be using IP Pools and what those will be.

## Step 2: Braze configures information

After receiving your email, we'll get to work configuring your IPs, domains and subdomains, and IP pools.

## Step 3: Add DNS records

After your IPs, domains, subdomains, and IP pools are configured, we'll send you a list of DNS records. Ask your engineers/developers to add these DNS records where needed, and, after they have been added, let us know!

## Next steps

We will then check your setup and validate all information in our internal systems.

Our onboarding team will let you know when you're ready to go or if there are issues with your DNS records that you must address with your engineering team.
