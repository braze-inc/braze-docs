# Data points

At Braze, data means action: each piece of data that arrives in Braze updates segment membership, can trigger and cancel messaging, is immediately available for messaging personalization, and more. As such, data points are Braze’s way of defining a billing and pricing structure, based on pieces of information logged against user profiles. See the [Consumption count](#consumption-count) section of this article to understand what data counts toward your data point allocation.
 
Our Customer Success team can help recommend data best practices to fit your specific needs. You can find a more detailed breakdown of this definition in your Braze contract.

## Management and usage

To view your Data Point Dashboard, select your name in the top-right corner, click the drop down, and select **Subscriptions and Usage**. For more information on the Data Point Dashboard components, refer to [Subscriptions and usage]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/onboarding_with_braze/subscription_and_usage/).

{% alert tip %}
**Only update your deltas (changing data)!**

To prevent using up your allocated data points, we recommend setting up a program that will prevent sending the same, unchanging data from your app to Braze over and over.
{% endalert %}

## Consumption count

In sum, data points are accumulated when a user's profile data is updated or when they perform specific actions. Essentially, data points are counts of each of your users' `session starts`, `session ends`, `events`, and `purchases`.

You can find a breakdown of how Braze accumulates data points in the following sections, but there are nuances beyond what you see here, which may affect the number of remaining points you expect to see. If you ever have any questions about your billing, reach out to your Braze account manager.

{% alert note %} 
Connected Content does not consume data points—using Connected Content is a great way to reference data from other platforms without needing to bulk upload to Braze and use up your points!

### Special circumstances

#### CSV

Custom attributes uploaded via CSV count towards your data points, however csv imports for segmentation purposes (imports made with `external_id` as the only field) will not consume data points.

#### Arrays

An array (or string) is an ordered collection of items stored within a custom attribute. In terms of consumption, it costs one data point per API call it takes to update the array.

That means if you set the whole array at once, it counts as one data point. However if you add values to the array incrementally, it counts as one data point per value.
