- **Partner integrations:** We prioritize integrations with best of breed ecosystem technologies (and offer APIs) that make real-time, bi-directional data sharing easy.
- **Stream-processing architecture:** Customers can trigger actions on any data point ingested into Braze for segmentation, orchestration, and personalization.

Maintain a public bug bounty program to proactively address potential vulnerabilities and have a dedicated security team committed to safeguarding customer data.
- **Industry compliance:** Provide tools that promote adherence to data protection regulations, including GDPR and CCPA.
- **Data privacy:** Enable customers to manage end-user consent, process requests, and action consumer rights.
