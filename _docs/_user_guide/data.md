### Making customer data work harder

- **Flexible and component-based:** Our overarching goal is to help brands utilize their data more effectively (and fully). Built with a composable architecture, brands can leverage the technologies they need to make their data work harder, without unnecessary middleware. 
- **Partner integrations:** We prioritize integrations with best of breed ecosystem technologies (and offer APIs) that make real-time, bi-directional data sharing easy.
- **Stream-processing architecture:** Customers can trigger actions on any data point ingested into Braze for segmentation, orchestration, and personalization.

### Enhancing data agility to drive performance 

- **Easy audience construction:** Reduce reliance on technical teams to create audiences and deliver personalized customer engagement at scale. 
- **Speed and performance:** Engagement data and insights are delivered in real-time, which supports iterative, effective customer engagement, as well as broader business decision-making.

### Keeping brands’ data secure, safe, and compliant

- **Industry leading security practices:** Conduct regular third-party audits, including SOC 2 Type 2 and ISO 27001, to ensure compliance with the highest industry standards. Maintain a public bug bounty program to proactively address potential vulnerabilities and have a dedicated security team committed to safeguarding customer data.
- **Industry compliance:** Provide tools that promote adherence to data protection regulations, including GDPR and CCPA.
- **Data privacy:** Enable customers to manage end-user consent, process requests, and action consumer rights.
