# Adding Braze account users

> There is no limit to the number of users (administrators or limited users) you can have on your company account. Your company admins will be responsible for adding users and setting relevant permissions. However, if there is only one admin left in your app group, that individual will not be able to remove their own admin permissions.

To add a new user to your Braze account, ensure you have admin privileges and perform the following:

1. Go to the **Manage Users** page under your username.<br><br>![Manage Users option of the profile dropdown.][1]{: style="max-width:50%"}<br><br>
2. Click **+ Add New User**.<br><br>
3. Enter their information as prompted, including their email, department, and [user role]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/manage_your_braze_users/user_permissions/#editing-user-permissions).<br><br>![][2]<br><br>
4. For users with a limited role, select the company level and app group level permissions you want this user to have.<br><br>![][3]

{% alert important %}
You must select a department for each user added to your company's Braze account. <br><br>Adding your department to your user profile helps ensure you receive relevant communications built around how you use Braze. You will receive support and alerts that apply to you.
