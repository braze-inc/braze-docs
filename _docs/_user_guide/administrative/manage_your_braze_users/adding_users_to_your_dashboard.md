# Adding Users

Go to the __Manage Users__ page under your username and click the __Add New User__ button. Then, enter their information (including email and department) as prompted.

![Adding a User][27]

There is no limit on the number of users (either administrators or limited users) you can have on your company account. However, if there is only one admin left in your app group, that individual will not be able to remove their own admin permission.

{% alert important %}

You are required to select a department for each user you add to your company's Braze account.

Adding your department to your user profile helps to ensure you receive relevant communications built around how you use Braze. You will receive support and alerts that apply to you.
