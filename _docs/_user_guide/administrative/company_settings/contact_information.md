# Company Contact Information

If you're an admin (you'll see so in the top, right corner), this is where you can manage your company's contact information and time zone.

Make sure to hit _Save_ before you leave the page!


{% alert warning %}

Switching time zones can cause some data discrepancies around the point when the time zone was changed. If someone switches their time zone, we make a good faith effort to convert things over accurately, but it is not always a perfect conversion. You may notice a discontinuity in your data, where it may switch between time zones.
