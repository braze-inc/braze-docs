# Company contact information

<style>
.fa-crown {
  color: gold;
}
</style>

You can get to the **Company Settings** section by clicking on your name, then selecting **Company Settings** in the drop-down. If you're an admin (you'll see a <i class="fas  fa-crown" aria-label="crown icon"></i> next to your name), this page is where you can manage your company's contact information and time zone.

Make sure to hit **Save** before you leave the page!


{% alert warning %}

Switching time zones can cause some data discrepancies around the point when the time zone was changed. If someone switches their time zone, we make a good faith effort to convert things over accurately, but it is not always a perfect conversion. You may notice a discontinuity in your data, where it may switch between time zones.
