# Notification preferences

> If you would like to monitor the messaging and activity in your company account, you can choose to set up specific notifications and select where they go.

The **Notification Preferences** page is where you can configure who (if anyone) receives notifications about your company. You can configure who should receive notifications about campaign delivery or technical errors. You can also specify recipients for the weekly analytics report. For most notifications, Braze supports email and webhook channels.

![Notification Preferences page in the Braze dashboard][61]

To access the **Notification Preferences** page, select your account dropdown and go to **Company Settings** > **Notification Preferences**.

{% alert note %}
If you're using our [updated navigation]({{site.baseurl}}/navigation), you can find **Notification Preferences** under **Settings** > **Company Settings** > **Admin Settings** > **Notification Preferences**.
{% endalert %}

## Slack incoming webhook integration

Slack has an [incoming webhook app][67] that allows messages to be posted from external sources into Slack. To get started, open the incoming webhook app.

1. Select the Slack channel that you'd like the notifications to go to and click **Add Incoming Webhooks Integration**.<br><br>
    ![Add incoming webhooks integration in Slack][63]<br><br>
  Slack will generate a URL that you'll need to enter into Braze for the notifications that you wish to receive.<br><br>
2. Copy the **Webhook URL**.<br><br>
    ![Copy webhook URL][64]<br><br>
3. Navigate to the **Notification Preferences** tab in **Company Settings**.<br><br>
4. Select the notification that you wish to enable for Slack. Or, if you have multiple notifications that you want to send to this Slack channel, use **Bulk Add** to add the webhook to multiple notifications.<br><br>
    ![Select Slack notifications to enable][65]{: style="max-width:60%;"}<br><br>
5. Enter the URL that Slack generated for you.

That's it! You should start receiving notifications about your company to this Slack channel. You can also check out Slack's help article on this topic: [Sending messages using Incoming Webhooks][62].
