# Setting user permissions

> Braze's user permission feature allows you to choose who can access your apps on the Braze dashboard by assigning different users with either admin or limited permission. The creator of the workspace will automatically be granted administrator access.

These settings can be found at **Settings** > **Company Users**.

{% alert note %}
If you are using the [older navigation]({{site.baseurl}}/navigation), **Company Users** is called **Manage Users** and is located under your account icon.
{% endalert %}

![Account users list on the Manage Settings page][30]

|Level of Access|Permissions|
|---|---|
|Administrator|Administrators have access to all available features.|
|Limited|Limited users are completely customized at several levels, outlined in the following sections. When you switch a user's permissions from admin to limited, that user no longer has access to any portion of the Braze dashboard until you deem it so using the checkboxes that appear under the Edit User box.|

## Editing user permissions

From the **Company Users** page, you can edit a specific user's permissions, either by allowing them to remain as the default administrator role, or changing them to a limited role. To change their role, click the edit icon in the user's row and select **Limited** from the **User Role** dropdown.

![Selecting Administrator or Limited when editing a user][29]{: style="border:none"}

When you switch a user's permissions from **Administrator** to **Limited**, that user no longer has access to any portion of Braze until you set those specific permissions using the checkboxes that appear under the Edit User box.

## Limited and team role permissions

You can manage user permissions by group or on an individual basis when editing or adding a user from the **Company Users** page.

![Manage User Permissions][89]

|Permission Name|Definition/Parameters|
|---|---|
|Admin|Has access to all available features, default setting for all new users. Can update company settings (company name and time zone), which limited users are unable to do.|

This does not affect Content Cards.<br><br>Allows user to create and edit News Feed cards. You can still view News Feed cards without this permission. If your account is enabled for News Feed and a user should be able to launch existing Content Blocks, they need both **Publish Cards** and **Send campaigns, Canvases** permissions. |

If you are enabling this for a non-admin Braze user, **Access Campaigns, Canvases, Cards, Segments, Media Library** permissions must also be granted. |

## Permission sets

On the **Permission Sets** page found at **Settings** > **Permission Settings**, you can create, edit, and delete custom permission assignments for your Braze dashboard users. Permission sets can be assigned by selecting an existing user or creating a new one on the **Company Users** page, then choosing the appropriate permission set under **Workspace Level Permissions**.

![The Permission Sets tab opens a Manage Permissions Sets page with a table of permission set names and selected permissions.][5]

Each permission set can be defined for a specific group of users, such as in the following example:

Permission Set Name    | Permissions  
----------- | ---------------- 
Developers | “Access Dev Console”
Marketers | “Access Campaigns, Canvases, Cards, Feature Flags, Segments, Media Library, and Preference Centers” <br> “Manage Media Library”
User Management | “Manage Dashboard Users” <br> “Manage Teams”
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}
