# Setting user permissions

<style>
.fa-crown {
  color: gold;
}
</style>

> The user permissions feature allows you to choose who can access your apps on the Braze dashboard by assigning different users with either admin or limited permissions. The creator of the workspace will automatically be granted administrator access.

These settings can be found at **Settings** > **Company Users**.

{% alert note %}
If you're using the [older navigation]({{site.baseurl}}/navigation), **Company Users** is called **Manage Users** and is located under your account icon.
{% endalert %}

|Level of Access|Permissions|
|---|---|
|Administrator|Administrators have access to all available features.|
|Limited|Limited users are completely customized at several levels, outlined in the following sections. When you switch a user's permissions from **Administrator** to **Limited**, that user no longer has access to any portion of the Braze dashboard until you deem it so using the checkboxes that appear under the **Edit User** section.|
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

## Editing user permissions

To edit a specific user's permissions, either by assigning permissions to the default **Limited** role or changing the user to an **Administrator** role, do the following:

1. Go to the **Company Users** page. 
2. Click the edit icon in the user's row.
3. To make a user an admin, select **This user is an admin**. To demote an admin to a limited role, clear the checkbox.

![Selecting Administrator or Limited when editing a user]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/editing_user_permission_new.png %} "Edit User Permission"){: style="border:none"}

When you switch a user's permissions from **Administrator** to **Limited**, that user no longer has access to any portion of Braze until you set those specific permissions using the checkboxes that appear under the **Workspace-level permissions** section.

## Managing limited and team role permissions

You can manage user permissions by group or on an individual basis when editing or adding a user from the **Company Users** page.

{% alert important %}
As of April 2024, to create or update promotion code lists, Braze users need the “Access Campaigns, Canvases, Cards, Segments, Media Library” permission.
{% endalert %}

|Permission Name|Definition/Parameters|

## App-by-app user permissions

Individual users can be granted different degrees of access on an app-by-app basis.

|Limited Permission Degree|Details|
|---|---|---|
|Company Level|Manages the company's app and group settings.|
|Workspace Level Permissions|Determines which workspaces should be managed by the user.|
|App Level Settings|Determines the user's level of editing access.|
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3}

## Permission sets and roles

You can bundle relevant permissions with permission sets and roles by navigating to **Settings** > **Permission Settings**.

### Permission sets

Use permission sets to bundle permissions related to specific subject areas or actions. They can be applied to dashboard users who need the same access across different workspaces, such as in the following example:

Permission Set Name    | Permissions  
----------- | ---------------- 
Developers | “Access Dev Console”
Marketers | “Access Campaigns, Canvases, Cards, Feature Flags, Segments, Media Library, and Preference Centers” <br> “Manage Media Library Assets”
User Management | “Manage Dashboard Users” <br> “Manage Teams”
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

#### Assigning permission sets

Assign permission sets by selecting an existing user or creating a new one on the **Company Users** page, then choosing the appropriate permission set under **Workspace Level Permissions**.

### Roles

{% alert note %}
Roles are currently in early access. Contact your Braze customer success manager if you are interested in participating in the early access. 
{% endalert %}

Roles allow for more structure by bundling together individual custom permissions and workspace access controls. This is especially useful if you have many different brands or regional workspaces in one dashboard. With roles, you can add dashboard users to the right workspaces and directly grant them the associated permissions.

| Role Name    | Workspace | Permissions  
----------- | ----------- | ---------
| Marketer - Fashion Brands | {::nomarkdown}[DEV] Fashion Brand, [QA] Fashion Brand, [PROD] Fashion Brand {:/} | “Access Campaigns, Canvases, Cards, Feature Flags, Segments, Media Library, and Preference Center"<br>“Manage Media Library Assets” |
| Marketer - Skincare Brands | {::nomarkdown}[DEV] Skincare Brand, [QA] Skincare Brand, [PROD] Skincare Brand {:/} | “Access Campaigns, Canvases, Cards, Feature Flags, Segments, Media Library, and Preference Centers” <br>“Manage Media Library Assets” |
| User Management - All Brands | {::nomarkdown}[DEV] Fashion Brand, [QA] Fashion Brand, [PROD] Fashion Brand, [DEV] Skincare Brand, [QA] Skincare Brand, [PROD] Skincare Brand {:/} | “Manage Dashboard Users”<br>“Manage Teams” |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3}

#### Assigning roles

Assign roles by selecting an existing user or creating a new one on the **Company Users** page, then choosing the appropriate role under **Workspace Level Permissions**.

## Exporting user permissions

You can download a CSV of your dashboard users and their associated permissions by clicking **Export Users** on the **Company Users** page. A CSV will be sent to the email address associated with your Braze account.
