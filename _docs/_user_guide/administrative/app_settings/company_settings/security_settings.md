# Security settings

> As an administrator, security is a high priority on your list of concerns. The **Security Settings** page can help you manage the generic, cross-company security settings, including authentication rules, IP allowlisting, and two-factor authentication.

To access this page, go to **Settings** > **Admin Settings** > **Security Settings**.

## Authentication rules

### Password length

Use this field to change the minimum password length required. The default minimum is eight characters.

### Password complexity

Select **Enforce complex passwords** to require passwords to include at least one of each of the following: 
- Uppercase letter
- Lowercase letter
- Number
- Special character

### Password re-usability

Determines the minimum number of new passwords that must be set before a user can reuse a password. The default is three.

### Password expiration rules

Use this field to set when you want your Braze account users to reset their password.

### Session duration rules

Use this field to define how long Braze will keep your session active. After Braze deems your session inactive (no activity for the defined number of minutes), the user will be logged out. The maximum number of minutes you can enter is 10,080 (equal to one week) if two-factor authentication is enforced for your company, otherwise, the maximum session duration will be 1,440 minutes (equal to 24 hours).

### Single sign-on (SSO) authentication

You can restrict your users from logging in using a password or SSO.

For [SAML SSO]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/single_sign_on/), customers need to set up their SAML settings before enforcing. If customers use Google SSO, they only need to enforce the security settings page with no additional lift.

## Dashboard IP allowlisting

Use the field shown to allowlist specific IP addresses and subnets from which users can log in to your account (for example, from a company network or VPN). Specify IP addresses and subnets as CIDR ranges in a comma-separated list. If not specified, users will be able to log in from any IP address.

## Two-factor authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication is required for all Braze users. It adds a second level of identity verification to an account log, making it more secure than just a username and password. If your dashboard cannot support two-factor authentication, contact your customer success manager. 

When two-factor authentication is turned on:

- In addition to entering a password, users will need to enter a verification code when logging in to their Braze account. The code can be sent through an authenticator app, email, or SMS. 
- The **Remember this account for 30 days** checkbox becomes available to users.

Users who fail to set up their two-factor authentication will be locked out of their Braze account. Braze account users also can set up two-factor authentication on their own in **Account Settings**, even if not required by the administrator.

Be sure to save your changes before leaving the page!

### Remember this account for 30 days {#remember-me}

This feature is available when two-factor authentication is turned on.

When you select **Remember this account for 30 days**, a cookie is stored on your device, only requiring you to log in with two-factor authentication once over the course of 30 days. 

![Remember this account for 30 days checkbox]({% image_buster /assets/img/remember_me.png %}){: style="float:right;max-width:50%;margin-left:15px;"}

Customers with multiple accounts under a dashboard company may experience issues using this feature due to the cookie being tied to a specific device. If users use the same device to log in to multiple accounts, the cookie will be replaced for the previously authorized accounts on that device. Braze expects only one device to be associated with an account, not one device for multiple accounts.

### Resetting user authentication

If you're having issues logging in with two-factor authentication, contact your company administrators to reset your two-factor authentication. Administrators can perform the following steps:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Company Users**.
2. Select the user from the provided list.
3. Select **Reset** under **Two Factor Authentication**.

A reset can solve common authentication issues such as trouble with authenticator apps, email verification not sending, login failure due to SMS outages or user error, and more.

### Requirements for 2FA at the company level

First, verify whether 2FA is enabled for your dashboard by going to **Company Settings** > **Security Settings** > **Two Factor Authentication**. If the toggle is gray, 2FA hasn't been turned on for your company and isn't mandatory for all dashboard users.

#### User options when 2FA isn't mandatory

If 2FA isn't enforced at the company level, individual users can set up 2FA for themselves on their Account Settings page. In this case, users won't be locked out of their accounts if they don't set it up. You can identify which users have opted to enable 2FA by checking the Manage Users page.

#### Requirements when 2FA is mandatory

If 2FA is enforced at the company level, users who don't set it up on their own accounts upon logging in will be locked out of the dashboard. Users must complete the 2FA setup to maintain access.

{% alert important %}
2FA is required for all Braze users only if Single Sign-On (SSO) isn't enabled. If SSO is in use, 2FA doesn't need to be enforced at the company level.
{% endalert %}

## Setting up two-factor authentication (2FA)

### Setting up 2FA with Authy

1. Download the Authy App from your device's app store.
2. In Braze, input your phone number.
3. Tap the notification sent to your device prompting you to open the Authy app.
4. Launch the Authy app on your device to retrieve the code.
5. In Braze, input the verification code you received from Authy.

If you encounter issues during the setup process and are redirected to the Braze homepage or login screen, try the following:

- Use incognito or private browsing mode: Attempt setup again with an incognito or private browsing window. This can bypass issues caused by browser extensions or plugins.
- Try a different browser profile: If the problem persists, consider using a different browser profile to eliminate conflicts with installed plugins.

### Setting up 2FA when it isn't enforced

To manually activate two-factor authentication (2FA) on your Braze account when it isn't enforced, follow these steps:

1. Download a 2FA app like Authy, Google Authenticator, Okta Verify, or similar from the App Store (iOS), Google Play Store (Android), or the web. Or, if you prefer to set up 2FA with email or SMS, skip to step 2.
2. In Braze, go to Manage Account, scroll to the **Two-Factor Authentication** section, then select **Start Setup**.
3. Enter your password into the login modal, then select **Check Password**.
4. In the **Two-Factor Authentication Setup** modal, enter your phone number, then select **Enable**.
5. Copy the generated seven-digit code from your 2FA app, email, or SMS message, then go back to Braze and paste it into the **Two-Factor Authentication Setup** modal. Select **Verify**.
6. (Optional) To avoid entering 2FA for the next 30 days, enable the **Remember this account for 30 days** option.

## Elevated Access

Elevated Access adds an extra layer of security for sensitive actions in your Braze dashboard. When active, users need to re-verify their account before exporting a segment or viewing an API key. To use Elevated Access, go to **Settings** > **Admin Settings** > **Security Settings** and toggle it on. 

If a user can’t re-verify, they’ll be redirected to where they left off and won’t be able to continue with the sensitive action. After they successfully re-verify, they won’t need to do so again for the next hour—unless they log out first.

## Downloading a security event report

The Security Event report is a CSV report of security events such as account invitations, account removals, failed and successful login attempts, and other activities. You can use it to perform internal audits.

To download this report, do the following:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Admin Settings**.
2. Select the **Security Settings** tab and go to the **Security Event Download** section.
2. Select **Download report**. 

This report only contains the most recent 10,000 security events for your account. If you need specific event data, contact technical support.

## Viewing personally identifiable information (PII) {#view-pii}

The **View PII** permission is only accessible to a few select Braze users. By default, all admins have their **View PII** permission turned on in user permissions. This means they can see all standard and custom attributes that your company has defined as PII throughout the dashboard. When this permission is turned off for users, those users won't be able to see any of those attributes.

For the existing team permission capabilities, refer to [Setting user permissions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/manage_your_braze_users/user_permissions/#available-limited-and-team-role-permissions).

### Defining PII

{% alert important %}
Selecting and defining certain fields as PII fields only affects what Users can view on the Braze dashboard and does not impact how the End User data in such PII fields is handled.<br><br>Consult your legal team to align your dashboard's settings with any privacy regulations and policies applicable to your company, including those related to [data retention]({{site.baseurl}}/data_retention/).
{% endalert %}

You can select the fields your company designates as PII in the dashboard. To do this, go to **Company Settings** > **Admin Settings** > **Security Settings**.

The following attributes can be designated as PII and hidden from Braze users who don't have **View PII** permissions.

| Standard attributes | Custom attributes |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| {::nomarkdown} <ul> <li>Email address </li> <li> Phone number </li> <li> First name </li> <li> Last name </li> <li> Gender </li> <li> Birthday </li> <li> Device IDs </li> <li> Most recent location </li> </ul> {:/} | {::nomarkdown} <ul> <li> All custom attributes<ul><li>Individual custom attributes can be marked as PII if you don't need to hide all attributes.</li></ul></li> </ul> {:/} |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation" }

### Limited areas

The following assumes that all fields are set as PII, and the users mentioned are those who use the Braze platform.

| Dashboard Navigation | Result | Notes |
| -------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| User search | The user who logs in is unable to search by email address, phone number, first name, or last name: {::nomarkdown} <ul> <li> Won't be shown the preceding standard and custom attributes when viewing a user profile. </li> <li> Can't edit the preceding standard attributes of a user profile from the Braze dashboard. </li> </ul> {:/} | Access to this section still requires access to view the user profile. |
| User import | The user can't download files from the **User Import** page. | |
| {::nomarkdown} <ul> <li> Segments </li> <li> Campaigns </li> <li> Canvas </li> </ul> {:/} | In the **User Data** dropdown: {::nomarkdown} <ul> <li> The user won't have the <b>CSV Export Email Address</b> option. </li> <li> The user won't be provided the preceding standard and customer attributes in the CSV file when selecting <b>CSV Export User Data</b>. </li> </ul> {:/} | |
| Internal test group | The user won't have access to the preceding standard attributes of any user added to the internal test group. | |
| Message activity log | The user won't have access to the preceding standard attributes for any users identified in the message activity log. | |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3 role="presentation" }

{% alert note %}
When previewing a message, the **View PII** permission isn't applied, so users can see the preceding standard attributes if they were referenced in the message through Liquid.
{% endalert %}

## Data deletion preferences 

You can use this setting to set preferences for whether certain fields should be deleted during the user delete process for events. These preferences only impact data for users who have been deleted from Braze. 

When a user is deleted, Braze removes all PII from event data but retains the anonymized data for analytics purposes. Some user-defined fields may contain PII if you send end-user information to Braze. If these fields contain PII, you can opt to delete the data when event data is anonymized for deleted users; if the fields contain no PII, they can be retained for analytics.

You are responsible for determining the correct preferences for your workspace. The best way to determine the appropriate settings is to review with internal teams sending events data to Braze and to teams using message extras in Braze to confirm whether the fields may contain PII.  

### Relevant fields  

| Event name or type | Field | Notes |
| -------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Custom event | properties |  |
| Purchase event | properties |  |
| Message send | message_extras | Several event types contain a `message_extras` field. The preference applies to all message send event types that support `message_extras`, including event types added in the future. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3 role="presentation" }

{% alert warning %}
**Deletion is permanent!** If you opt to remove any fields from Snowflake for deleted users, the setting will apply to all historical data in your workspaces and any events for users deleted in the future. After Braze has run the process to apply the settings to historical event data for deleted users, the data **cannot be restored**.
{% endalert %}

### Configure preferences

Set default preferences by checking boxes for any fields that should be removed if a user is deleted. Select any of the fields that contain PII. This preference will apply to all current and future workspaces unless workspaces are explicitly added to a preference group.

To customize preferences by workspace, you may add preference groups with different settings from the default. We apply the default settings to any workspaces not added to an additional preference group, including workspaces created in the future.

## Troubleshooting 

### Two-factor authentication (2FA) setup loop issues

If you find yourself caught in a loop after successfully entering your phone number for 2FA and are redirected back to the login page, this is likely due to failing to verify on the first attempt. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Turn off any ad-blockers.
2. Enable cookies in your browser settings.
3. Restart your PC or laptop.
4. Attempt to set up 2FA again.

If the problem persists after these steps, contact [Support]({{site.baseurl}}/braze_support/) for assistance.

### Can't enable two-factor authentication (2FA)

If 2FA is enabled but nothing happens when you select the **Enable** button, it may be due to your browser blocking the redirect needed to send the verification code through SMS. Here are steps to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Temporarily suspend any ad-blockers you have enabled in your browser.
2. Confirm that you've enabled third-party cookies in your browser settings.
3. Try to set up 2FA.

### Verification code doesn't send

If you encounter issues when entering your phone number on the Authy page and don't receive an SMS, follow these steps:

1. Install the Authy app on your phone and log into the Authy authenticator.
2. Enter your phone number and check the Authy app for any changes or SMS notifications.
3. If you still don't receive the SMS, try using a different network connection, such as your home network or a non-corporate Wi-Fi. Corporate networks may have security policies that interfere with SMS delivery.

If issues persist, delete the old profile in the Authy app and scan the QR code again to set up 2FA. Ensure that you have disabled any ad blockers, enabled third-party cookies, or used a different browser before attempting the setup again.
