### Consequences of switching your time zone

{% alert warning %}

Switching time zones can cause some data discrepancies around the point when the time zone was changed. If someone switches their time zone, we make a good faith effort to convert things over accurately, but it is not always a perfect conversion. You may notice a discontinuity in your data, where it may switch between time zones.

{% endalert %}

If you choose to switch your time zone, you may experience a variety of consequences, including:

- While campaigns scheduled for specific times in specific locations (such as 9 pm Eastern Time) will run properly on schedule until edited, both campaign analytics and future campaign schedules will be affected by the change.
- Any card scheduling that is not assigned to local time may be affected, with active cards potentially appearing as finished or the other way around.
- Segmentation filters of the form "Has done X before/after `Date`" will have the time adjusted because the initial date will now be localized in Pacific Time.
