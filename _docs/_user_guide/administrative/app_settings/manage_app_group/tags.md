# Tags

Braze tracks author, editor, date, and status information about segments, campaigns, Canvases and News Feed cards, and gives you the ability to create tags to further organize and sort your engagement.

## Campaign, Segment, and News Feed Card Tags

You can add tags when creating or editing a campaign, Canvas, segment, or News Feed card. Click <span style="font-size: 14px;margin-bottom: .5rem;height: 16px;width: 16px;" class="fas fa-tag" ></span>**Tags** below the engagement name and select an existing tag, or start typing to add a new tag.

![Campaign Creation][I1]

You can also add tags to multiple campaigns, Canvases, segments, or News Feed cards by selecting multiple engagements and clicking <span style="font-size: 14px;margin-bottom: .5rem;height: 16px;width: 16px;" class="fas fa-tag" ></span>**Tag As**.

![Tagging multiple][I4]

The tags set on a campaign, Canvas, segment, or News Feed card are visible on the detail page below the engagement name.

![Campaign Details][I2]

They are also visible in the list of campaigns, Canvases, segments, and News Feed cards as bubbles above the engagement name, along with status labels such as **Archived** and **Draft**.

![Campaigns][I3]

To filter by a tag, select the tag name in the left-hand toolbar or search for the tag in the search pane using the `tag:` selector. For example, to search for the `Onboarding` tag, enter "tag:Onboarding".

## Best Practices {#tags-best-practices}

Tags can be a useful organizational tool for keeping track of engagement tactics. You can link segments, campaigns, and News Feed cards to business objectives, funnel stages, and the like.

Below is an example of tags an eCommerce app might find useful:

You can use the same tags across segments, campaigns, and News Feed cards. To efficiently rename or remove tags across your dashboard, use the **Tags** tab under **Manage Settings**.
