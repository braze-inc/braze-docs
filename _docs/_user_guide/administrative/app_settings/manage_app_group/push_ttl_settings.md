# Push time to live settings

The **Push TTL Settings** tab in **Manage Settings** enables you to control the delivery attempt duration for offline devices. This means if a user's device is offline when your campaign sends, Braze will attempt to deliver the message up to your set time on this page.

This feature will not remove a notification if it has already been received by the user's deviceâ€”it will only control how long the push provider will attempt to deliver a notification.
