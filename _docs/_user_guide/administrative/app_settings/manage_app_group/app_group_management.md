# App Group Management
You can manage, segment, and communicate with multiple applications simultaneously all from the Manage App Group tab in your navigation pane.

App groups are designed to house versions of the same application across multiple platforms. Many clients also use app groups to contain free and premium versions of their application on the same platform.


## Renaming or Deleting Your App Group
Click the pencil on the ["App Settings"][19] page to rename your app group.

Delete your App Group entirely from the Dashboard by clicking the Settings Icon on your Manage App Group Page and selecting “Delete App Group”.

Click on the gear-shaped Settings icon and select “Delete App Group” from the drop down to delete your app group entirely from the Dashboard.
