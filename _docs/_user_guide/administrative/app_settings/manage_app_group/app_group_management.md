# App Group Management

You can manage, segment, and communicate with multiple applications simultaneously all from the **Manage Settings** page in the Braze Dashboard.

App groups are designed to house versions of the same application across multiple platforms. Many clients also use app groups to contain free and premium versions of their application on the same platform.

## Renaming or Deleting Your App Group

To rename your app group, click <span style="font-size: 14px;margin-bottom: .5rem;height: 16px;width: 16px;" class="fas fa-pencil-alt" ></span>**Edit** on the [Settings][19] page.

To delete your App Group entirely from the Dashboard, click <span style="font-size: 14px;margin-bottom: .5rem;height: 16px;width: 16px;" class="fas fa-cog" ></span>**Settings** on the same page and select **Delete App Group**.
