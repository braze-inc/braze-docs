# Email settings

Email settings can be found within the **Manage Settings** page of the dashboard. Here, Braze allows you to set specific outbound email settings like custom footers, custom opt-in and opt-out pages, and more. Including these options in your outbound emails make for a fluid and cohesive experience for your users.

## Sending configuration

The email settings under the **Sending Configuration** section determine which details are included in your email campaigns. In particular, these settings are mainly related to what your user sees when they receive an email from Braze.

### Outbound email settings

When configuring your email settings, your outbound email settings identify which name and email addresses are used when Braze sends emails to your users.

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Display Name Address %}

In this section, you can add the names and email addresses that can be used when Braze sends emails to your users. The display names and email addresses will be available in the **Edit Sending Info** options as you compose your email campaign.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/email_settings/display_name_address.png %})

When setting your "From" addresses, make sure your "From" email domain matches your sending domain (i.e., marketing.yourdomain.com). Failure to do this may result in SPF and DKIM misalignment. All reply-to emails can be set to your root domain.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Reply-To Address %}

Adding an email address in this section allows you to select it as a reply-to address for your email campaign. You can also make an email address the default one by selecting **Make Default**. These email addresses will be available in the **Edit Sending Info** options as you compose your email campaign.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/email_settings/reply_to_address.png %}){: style="max-width:75%;" }

{% endtab %}
{% tab BCC Address %}

This section allows you to add and manage BCC addresses that can be appended to outbound email messages sent from Braze. Appending a BCC address to an email message will send an identical copy of the message your user receives to your BCC inbox. This is a useful tool to retain copies of messages you sent your users for compliance requirements or customer support issues.

{% alert important %} 
The **BCC Address** settings are currently in early access. Appending a BBC address to your campaign or Canvas will result in doubling your billable emails for the campaign or Canvas component since Braze will send one message to your user and one to your BCC address. Contact your customer success manager or open a [support ticket]({{site.baseurl}}/braze_support/) to enable this feature.
{% endalert %}

![BCC Address section of the Email Settings tab.]({% image_buster /assets/img/email_settings/bcc_address.png %}){: style="max-width:75%;" }

Once you add an address, the address will be made available to select when composing an email in either campaigns or Canvas steps. Select **Make Default** next to an address to set this address to be selected by default when launching a new email campaign or Canvas component. To override this at the message level, you can select **No BCC** when setting up your message.

If you require that all email messages sent from Braze have a BCC address included, you can select the **Require a BCC address for all your email campaigns** toggle. This will require you to select a default address which will be automatically selected on new email campaigns or Canvas steps. The default address will also be automatically added to all messages triggered through our REST API. There is no need to change the existing API request to include the address.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Open tracking pixel

[![Braze Learning course]({% image_buster /assets/img/bl_icon2.png %})](https://learning.braze.com/email-open-tracking-pixel/){: style="float:right;width:120px;border:0;" class="noimgborder"}

The email opening tracking pixel is an invisible 1px by 1px image that automatically gets inserted into your email HTML. This pixel helps Braze detect whether the end-users have opened your email. Email open information can be very useful, helping users determine effective marketing strategies by understanding the corresponding open rates.

### Placing the tracking pixel

Braze's default behavior is to append the tracking pixel to the bottom of your email. For the majority of users, this is the ideal place to put the pixel. While the pixel is already styled to cause as few visual changes as possible, any unintentional visual changes would be the least visible at the bottom of an email. This is also the default for email providers such as SendGrid and SparkPost.

### Changing location of tracking pixel

Braze currently supports overriding the ESP's default open tracking pixel location (the last tag in the `<body>` of an email) to move it to the first tag in the `<body>`.
  
![][13]{: style="max-width:80%;" }

To change the location:
1. Go to **Manage App Group**, then **Email Settings** in your Braze account.
2. Click the checkbox under **Custom Open Tracking Pixel Settings**. 
3. Press **Save**.

Once saved, Braze will send special instructions to the ESP in order to place the open tracking pixel at the top of all HTML emails.
  
{% alert important %} 
SSL enablement will wrap the URL of the tracking pixel with HTTPS instead of HTTP - if your SSL is misconfigured, it may affect the efficacy of the tracking pixel. 
{% endalert %}

## Include a list-unsubscribe header

![][00]{: style="float:right;max-width:60%;margin-left:15px;"}

This feature allows you to automatically include a list-unsubscribe header for emails sent to subscribed or opted-in users. This header allows email providers to include an **Unsubscribe** button when displaying an email.

Some recipients prefer to have an unsubscribe link available in the same place for all emails, rather than having to find links in each mailing. When enabled, this feature puts a prominent unsubscribe link in the header of the email, making it easier to unsubscribe and, therefore, helps reduce the likelihood that a user would mark your email as spam. This can have a significant impact on your reputation and deliverability as an email sender.

### How the list-unsubscribe header works

When enabled, this feature is applied to the entire app group. Braze will add a standard list-unsubscribe "mailto:" header to all eligible outgoing emails. This list-unsubscribe header is not customizable. Upon receiving a list-unsubscribe request from a user, Braze will ensure this user is unsubscribed. If there is no match, Braze will not process this request. 

![Option to automatically include a list-unsubscribe header for emails sent to subscribed or opted-in users.]({% image_buster /assets/img/email_settings/email_unsubscribe_header.png %}){: style="max-width:70%;" }

Note that the header is not added for messages targeting all users including unsubscribed users, as these represent transactional messages which do not need an unsubscribe function.

### Availability

Currently, only Windows Live Hotmail and Gmail support the list-unsubscribe header. Additionally, these ESPs may still choose not to provide you with this feature if you haven't completed [IP warming]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/onboarding_with_braze/email_setup/ip_warming/) yet, or if you are a new sender. This is because providers like Gmail won't include the unsubscribe option if they can't trust that you'll actually unsubscribe the user.

## Append email subject lines

Use the toggle to include "[TEST]" and "[SEED]" in your test and seed email subject lines. This can help identify any email campaigns sent as tests.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/email_settings/test_and_seed_email_subject_line.png %}){: style="max-width:70%;" }

## Inline CSS on new emails by default

CSS inlining is a technique that automatically inlines CSS styles for your emails and new emails. For some email clients, this can improve the way that your emails render.

Changing this setting will not affect any of your existing email messages or templates. You can override this default at any time while composing messages or templates. For more information, refer to [CSS inlining][10].

## Resubscribe users when their email changes

You may automatically resubscribe users when they change their email address. For example, if a previously unsubscribed app group user changes their email address to one that is not on Braze's unsubscribe list, they will automatically become resubscribed.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/email_settings/resubscribe_users.png %}){: style="max-width:90%;" }

## Subscription pages and footers

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Custom Footer %}

For commercial emails, the [CAN-SPAM Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003) requires that all commercial emails include an unsubscribe option. With the custom footer settings, you are able to remain CAN-SPAM compliant while also customizing your email opt-out footer. In order to remain compliant, you must add your custom footer to all emails sent as part of campaigns for this app group.

Note the following requirements when creating a custom footer for your email messaging:
- Must include an unsubscribe URL and physical mailing address.
- Should be less than 100 KB.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/email_settings/custom_footer.png %})

{% endtab %}
{% tab Custom Unsubscribe Page %}

Braze lets you set a **Custom Unsubscribe Page** with your own HTML. This page will appear once a user has selected to unsubscribe from the bottom of an email. Note that this page should be less than 750 KB. 

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/email_settings/custom_unsubscribe.png %})

{% endtab %}
{% tab Custom Opt-In Page %}

You can create a custom opt-in page using your own HTML. Including this in your email can be especially beneficial if you want your branding and message to remain consistent throughout your user lifecycle. Note that this page should be less than 750 KB.
