# Email settings

Email settings can be found within the **Manage Settings** page of the dashboard. Here, Braze allows you to set specific outbound email settings like display name, reply-to address, custom footers, custom opt-in and opt-out pages, and more. Including features like these in your outbound emails make for a fluid and cohesive customer experience.

## Outbound email settings

### Multiple sending emails

Use the following outbound email settings to change the name and email address used when Braze sends emails to your users. Using these settings, you may also include additional sending and reply-to addresses. These addresses will be available when building your campaign through the **Edit Sending Info** options available as you compose your campaign email.

Here, you may also exclude the "Reply-To" email and exclusively send replies to the "From" address.

![Outbound Email Settings section of the Email Settings tab.][1]

This feature allows you to:

- Set up multiple sending and reply-to email addresses
- Set a default sending and reply-to address
- Exclude the reply-to option and send replies to the "From" address

When setting your "From" addresses, make sure your "From" email domain matches your sending domain (i.e., marketing.yourdomain.com). Failure to do this may result in SPF and DKIM misalignment. All reply-to emails can be set to your root domain.

### BCC addresses

The **BCC Address** settings allow you to add and manage BCC addresses that can be appended to outbound email messages sent from Braze. Appending a BCC address to an email message will send an identical copy of the message your user receives to your BCC inbox. This is a useful tool to retain copies of messages you sent your users for compliance requirements or customer support issues.

{% alert important %} 
The **BCC Address** settings are currently in early access. Appending a BBC address to your campaign or Canvas will result in doubling your billable emails for the campaign or Canvas step since Braze will send one message to your user and one to your BCC address. Contact your customer success manager or open a [support ticket]({{site.baseurl}}/braze_support/) to enable this feature.
{% endalert %}

![BCC Address section of the Email Settings tab.][11]

Once you add an address, the address will be made available to select when composing an email in either campaigns or Canvas steps. Select **Make Default** next to an address to set this address to be selected by default when launching a new email campaign or Canvas step. If you'd like to override this at the message level, you can select **No BCC** when setting up your message.

If you require that all email messages sent from Braze have a BCC address included, you can check **Require a BCC address for all your email campaigns**. This will require you to select a default address which will be automatically selected on new email campaigns or Canvas steps. The default address will also be automatically added to all messages triggered through our REST API. 

There is no need to change the existing API request to include the address. Checking the box in the Braze dashboard to require BCC will set the address at the time of sending.

### Custom footer

For commercial emails, the [CAN-SPAM Act][5] requires that all commercial emails include an unsubscribe option. With the custom footer settings, you are able to remain CAN-SPAM compliant while also customizing your email opt-out footer. In order to remain compliant, you must add your custom footer to all emails sent as part of campaigns for this app group.

![][0]

To learn more about custom footer Liquid templating, check out our documentation on [Custom footers]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/managing_user_subscriptions/#changing-email-subscriptions).

Note the following requirements when creating a custom footer for your email messaging:

- Must include an unsubscribe URL and physical mailing address.
- Should be less than 100KB.

To learn more about email best practices, refer to [Managing email subscriptions][7].

## Custom pages

### Unsubscribe

Braze lets you set a **Custom Unsubscribe Page** with your own HTML. This page will appear once a user has selected to unsubscribe from the bottom of an email.

![][3]

Note that this page should be less than 750KB. Learn more about best practices for email list management in [Managing email subscriptions][7].

### Opt-in

You can create a custom opt-in page using your own HTML. This feature is great if you want your branding and message to remain consistent throughout your user lifecycle.

Note that this page should be less than 750KB. Learn more about best practices for email list management in [Managing email subscriptions][7].

## Email open tracking pixel

The email opening tracking pixel is an invisible 1px by 1px image that automatically gets inserted into your email HTML. This pixel helps Braze detect whether the end-users have opened your email. Email open information can be very useful, helping users determine effective marketing strategies by understanding the corresponding open rates.

### Placing the tracking pixel

Braze's default behavior is to append the tracking pixel to the bottom of your email. For the vast majority of users, this is the ideal place to put the pixel. While the pixel is already styled to cause as few visual changes as possible, any unintentional visual changes would be the least visible at the bottom of an email. This is also the default for email providers such as SendGrid and SparkPost.

However, a small subset of companies may prefer that the pixel get templated to a different location. One advantage of not placing the tracking pixel at the bottom is avoiding cases where it gets cut off by clients (e.g., Gmail) that truncate emails after a certain amount of kilobytes.

### Changing location of tracking pixel

Braze currently supports overriding the ESP's default open tracking pixel location (the last tag in the <body> of an email) to move it to the first tag in the <body>.
  
![Custom open tracking pixel settings][13]

To change the location:
1. Go to **Manage App Group**, then **Email Settings** in your Braze account.
2. Click the checkbox under **Custom Open Tracking Pixel Settings**. 
3. Press **Save**.

Once saved, Braze will send special instructions to the ESP in order to place the open tracking pixel at the top of all HTML emails.
  
{% alert important %} 
SSL enablement will wrap the URL of the tracking pixel with HTTPS instead of HTTP - if your SSL is misconfigured, it may affect the efficacy of the tracking pixel. 
{% endalert %}
  
## Toggle-Capable Features

![][2]{: style="float:right;max-width:30%;margin-left:15px;"}

The three email settings listed are features that require no additional action other than toggling it on or off by using the corresponding switch. Read each setting for further details.

### Resubscribe users when their email changes

You may automatically resubscribe users when they change their email address. For example, if a previously unsubscribed app group user changes their email address to one that is not on Braze's unsubscribe list, they will automatically become resubscribed.

### Include a list-unsubscribe header

![][00]{: style="float:right;max-width:60%;margin-left:15px;"}

This feature allows you to automatically include a list-unsubscribe header for emails sent to subscribed or opted-in users. This header allows email providers to include an **Unsubscribe** button when displaying an email.

Some recipients prefer to have an unsubscribe link available in the same place for all emails, rather than having to find links in each mailing. When enabled, this feature puts a prominent unsubscribe link in the header of the email client, making it easier to unsubscribe and therefore less likely that customers will mark your email as Spam. This has a significant impact on your reputation and deliverability as an email sender.

#### How the list-unsubscribe header works

Navigate to **Email Settings** within your app group. Toggle **List-Unsubscribe** to **ON**.

![Option to automatically include a list-unsubscribe header for emails sent to subscribed or opted-in users.] [59]

When enabled, this feature will add a standard list-unsubscribe "mailto:" header to all eligible outgoing emails. Upon receiving a list-unsubscribe request from a user, Braze will ensure this user is unsubscribed. If there is no match, Braze will not process this request.

{% alert note %}
This feature only applies to emails that target users who are “subscribed or opted in” or “opted-in only.”
{% endalert %}

The header is not added for messages targeting all users including unsubscribed users, as these represent transactional messages which do not need an unsubscribe function.

Note that currently, only Windows Live Hotmail and Gmail support this feature.

{% alert note %}
If you use Mailjet, you do not have the flexibility to choose on or off for this feature. By default, your list-unsubscribe header will be enabled.
{% endalert %}

### Inline CSS on new emails by default

CSS inlining is a technique that automatically inlines CSS styles for your emails and new emails. For some email clients, this can improve the way that your emails render.

Changing this setting will not affect any of your existing email messages or templates. You can override this default at any time while composing messages or templates.

For more information, refer to [CSS inlining][10].
