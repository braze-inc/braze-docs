# Exports log

> Use the **Export Logs** page to view the status of export jobs and cancel ongoing exports directly from the Braze platform. For information about the export tool, refer to [Exporting segment data to CSV]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/export_braze_data/segment_data_to_csv/).

{% alert important %}
The exports log is in early access. If you're interested in participating in the early access, reach out to your customer success manager.
{% endalert %}

You can find the exports log by going to **Settings** > **Exports Log**. Here, you can view previous exports, the name of exported segments, the status for each export, the source of each export, and when each export started and finished.
