# Exports log

> Use the **Exports Log** page to view the status of export jobs and cancel ongoing exports directly from the Braze platform. <br><br> Currently, the exports log only supports segment exports. For information about the segment export tool, refer to [Exporting segment data to CSV]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/export_braze_data/segment_data_to_csv/).

You can find the exports log by going to **Settings** > **Exports Log**. Here, you can view previous exports, the name of exported segments, the status of each export, the source of each export, and when each export started and finished.
