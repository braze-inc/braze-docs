# Event User Log Tab

The Event User Log can help you break down, debug, or otherwise troubleshoot issues in your Braze Integration. This tab gives you a log of errors that details the type of error, which app it's associated with, when it happened, and often an opportunity to view the raw data associated with it.

To find your logs easily, you can filter based on:

* SDK or API
* App Names
* Time frame
* User

Each log is broken up into multiple sections, which can include:

* Device Attributes
* User Attributes
* Events
* Campaign Events
* Response Data

Click the “Raw Data” button to show the raw `JSON` data for that specific log.

![Raw logs][10]

Event User Logs will remain in the dashboard for thirty (30) days after they are logged.
