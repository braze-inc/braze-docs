# Message Activity Log Tab {#dev-console-troubleshooting}

The Message Activity Log, in the Developer Console, gives you the opportunity to see any messages, especially error messages, associated with your campaigns and sends. You can see API campaign transactions, troubleshoot details on failed messages, and gather insight on how to improve notification delivery or solve existing technical issues.

![msgactlog1][2]

These messages can come from our own system, your apps or platforms, or our third party partners. This can result in an infinite number of messages that can appear in this log.

To determine what your messages mean, pay attention to the wording of each message and the columns that correspond with it, as it can help you troubleshoot using context clues. For example, if you have a log entry whose message states "empty-cart_app" and you aren't sure what that means, look to the left at the Type column. If you see "Aborted Message Error", you can safely assume the message was what was written as the abort message using [Liquid][1], and that the message was aborted because the intended recipient of the message had an empty cart in your app.

However, there are some common message types you might see, and some might even provide troubleshooting links to help you diagnose and fix issues.

|Message Type|Sample Text in Message Column|Context/Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|Block|The email account that you tried to reach is disabled. Learn more at _SAMPLE URL_.|Your message never reached this person's inbox - because there was no inbox to reach! If you want to dig further in, messages like this can sometimes have links in the __View Details__ column that will allow you to view the intended recipient's profile.|
|Block|Spam message is rejected because of anti-spam policy. For more information, please visit _SAMPLE URL_.| Uh oh. Looks like your message got categorized as spam here. It might just might be for that intended recipient, but if you're seeing this message a lot, you might want to re-evaluate your send habits or the content of your message. Also, think back - did you do an [IP warm-up][8]? If not, reach out to Braze for advice on getting one going.|
|Aborted Message Error| empty-cart_web| If you have an app with a cart or you create a send with an abort message in the Liquid, you can customize what message is returned to you if the send is aborted. In this case, the message returned is empty-cart_web.|
