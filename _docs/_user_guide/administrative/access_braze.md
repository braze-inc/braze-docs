## Supported browsers

The Braze dashboard supports the following browsers:
- Chrome (version 87 or newer)
- Firefox (version 85 or newer)
- Safari (version 15.4 or newer)
- Edge (version 87 or newer)

If your Braze dashboard says you have an unexpected error and your browser console tool shows the error `ReferenceError: structuredClone is not defined`, your browser is outdated. If this error keeps reoccurring, uninstall and reinstall your browser.

#### Creating a helpful Support ticket

If you contact Support, it'll be useful to have the impacted user collect network logs (Har Logs) from their browser while the issue occurs. This will show the network requests between the browser and the server, for the individual components of a webpage, and the Braze dashboard the user is trying to open.

Have the affected user do the following:

1. Open their developer tools. If using Chrome, this can be be done using the keyboard shortcut `option` + `âŒ˜` + `J` (on macOS). If using Windows or Linux, this can be done using the shortcut `shift` + `CTRL` + `J`.
2. Select **Network** > **Fetch/XHR** or **XHR**.
3. Capture a screen recording or screenshot showing the **Name**, **Status**, **Size**, and **Time** for the elements.<br><br>![The "Fetch/XHR" tab in a Chrome browser.][1]{: style="max-width:60%;"}

Then attach the user's recording or screenshot to the Support ticket. This information can help Support's investigation.
