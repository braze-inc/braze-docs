# SAML just-in-time provisioning 

> Just-in-time provisioning works with [SAML SSO]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/single_sign_on/set_up/) to allow new dashboard users to create a Braze account on their first sign in. This eliminates the need for administrators to manually create an account for a new dashboard user, choose their permissions, assign them to a workspace, and wait for them to activate their account.

## Prerequisites

This feature requires that SAML SSO is set up and integrated, and is not compatible with Google SSO.

## Setting up SAML just-in-time provisioning

Have a Braze administrator do the following:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Security Settings**.
2. In the **SAML SSO** section, toggle on the **Automatic user provisioning** option.
3. Select a default workspace to add a new dashboard user.
4. Select the default permission set to assign to that new dashboard user. To learn how to create a permission set, see [Setting user permissions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_your_braze_users/user_permissions/).
6. Select **Save changes** at the bottom of the page
7. In your SSO providerâ€™s settings, add all users that need Braze access to your SSO provider's directory.
8. Now users can sign up or log in.
