# Service Provider (SP) initiated login

> This article will walk you through how to enable SAML single sign-on for your Braze account.

## Requirements

Upon setup, you will be asked to provide a sign-on URL and an Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL.  

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Sign-On URL | `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.braze.com` <br><br> For the subdomain, use the coordinating subdomain listed in your [Braze instance URL]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/sdk_endpoints/). For example, if your instance is `US-01`, your URL is `https://dashboard-01.braze.com`. This means that your subdomain will be `dashboard-01`. |
| Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL | `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.braze.com/auth/saml/callback` <br><br> For some IdPs, this can also be referred to as the Reply URL, Audience URL, or Audience URI. |
| Entity ID | `braze_dashboard` |
| RelayState API key | Go to **Settings** > **API Keys** and create an API key with `sso.saml.login` permissions, and then input the generated API key as the `RelayState` parameter within your IdP. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

{% alert note %}
If you are using the [older navigation]({{site.baseurl}}/navigation), you can find your API keys under **Settings** at **Developer Console** > **API Settings**.
{% endalert %}

## SAML SSO setup

### Step 1. Configure your identity provider

Set up Braze as a Service Provider (SP) in your Identity Provider (IdP) with the following information. In addition, set up SAML attribute mapping.

{% alert important %}
If you plan on using Okta as your IdP, make sure to use the pre-built integration found on the [Okta site](https://www.okta.com/integrations/braze/).
{% endalert %}

| SAML Attribute | Required? | Accepted SAML Attributes |
|---|---|---|
|`email` | Required | `email` <br> `mail` <br> `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/email` |
| `first_name` | Optional | `first_name` <br> `firstname` <br> `firstName`<br>`http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/first_name` |
| `last_name` | Optional | `last_name` <br> `lastname` <br> `lastName` <br>`http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/last_name` |

{% alert note %}
Braze only requires `email` in the SAML Assertion.
{% endalert %}

### Step 2. Configure Braze

When you finish setting up Braze in your IdP, your IdP will provide you with a Target URL and `x.509` certificate to input into your Braze account. 

After your account manager turns on SAML SSO for your account, go to **Settings** > **Admin Settings** > **Security Settings** and toggle the SAML SSO section to **ON**. 

{% alert note %}
If you are using the [older navigation]({{site.baseurl}}/navigation), select your account icon and go to **Company Settings** > **Security Settings** to find the SAML SSO section.
{% endalert %}

On the same page, input the following:

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| `SAML Name` | This will appear as the button text on the login screen.<br>This is typically your IdP name, like "Okta." |
| `Target URL` | This is provided after setting up Braze within your IdP.<br> Some IdPs reference this as the SSO URL or SAML 2.0 Endpoint. |
| `Certificate` | The `x.509` certificate that is provided by your IdP.|
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

Make sure that your `x.509` certificate follows this format when adding it to the dashboard:

```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<certificate>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### Step 3. Sign into Braze

Save your Security Settings and log out, then sign back in with your IdP.

## SSO behavior

Members who opt to use SSO will no longer be able to use their password as they did prior. Users who continue to use their password will be able to unless restricted by the following settings.

## Restriction

You can restrict the members of your organization to sign-in with either Google SSO or SAML SSO. To turn on restrictions, go to **Security Settings** and select either **Enforce Google SSO only login** or **Enforce custom SAML SSO only login**.

![Authentication Rules section of Security Settings page]({% image_buster /assets/img/sso3.png %})

By turning on restrictions, your company's Braze users will no longer be able to log in using a password, even if they have logged in with a password before.
