# Service Provider (SP) initiated login

> This article will walk you through how to enable SAML single sign-on for your Braze account.

## Requirements

Upon setup, you will be asked to provide a sign-on URL and an Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL.  

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Sign-On URL | `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.braze.com/sign_in` <br><br> For the subdomain, use the coordinating subdomain listed in your [Braze instance URL]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/braze_instances/). For example, if your instance is `US-01`, your URL is `https://dashboard-01.braze.com`. This means that your subdomain will be `dashboard-01`. |
| Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL | `https://<SUBDOMAIN>/auth/saml/callback` <br><br> For some IdPs, this can also be referred to as the Reply URL, Audience URL, or Audience URI. |
| Entity ID | `braze_dashboard` |
| RelayState API key | Create an API key in the **Developer Console** under **API Settings** with `sso.saml.login` permissions, and then input the generated API key as the `RelayState` parameter within your IdP. |

## SAML SSO setup

### Configure your identity provider

First, you must set up Braze as a Service Provider (SP) in your Identity Provider (IdP) with the following information.

In addition, you'll need to set up SAML attribute mapping.

| SAML Attribute | Required? | Accepted SAML Attributes |
|---|---|---|
|`email` | Required | `email` <br> `mail` <br> `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/email` |
| `first_name` | Optional | `first_name` <br> `firstname` <br> `firstName`<br>`http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/first_name` |
| `last_name` | Optional | `last_name` <br> `lastname` <br> `lastName` <br>`http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/last_name` |

{% alert note %}
Braze only requires `email` in the SAML Assertion.
{% endalert %}

### Configure Braze

Once you have set up Braze within your IdP, they will provide a Target URL and `x.509` certificate which you will input into your Braze account.

After your account manager has enabled SAML SSO for your account, go to `Company Settings` > `Security Settings` and toggle the SAML SSO section to `ON`.

On this page, you, input:

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| `SAML Name` | This will appear as the button text on the login screen.<br>This is typically your IdP name, like "Okta." |
| `Target URL` | This is provided after setting up Braze within your IdP.<br> Some IdPs reference this as the SSO URL or SAML 2.0 Endpoint. |
| `Certificate` | The `x.509` certificate is provided by your IdP.|
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

Make sure that your certificate follows this format when adding it to the dashboard:

```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<certificate>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

When you save your Security Settings and log out, you should now be able to sign in with your IdP.

## SSO behavior

Members who opt to use SSO will **no longer be able to use their password as they did prior**. Users who continue to use their password will be able to unless restricted by the following settings. 

## Restriction

You can also choose to restrict the members of your organization to sign-in with either Google SSO or SAML SSO. In order to enable, go to **Company Settings** > **Security Settings** and select either **Enforce Google SSO only login** or **Enforce custom SAML SSO only login**.

By enabling this option, your company's Braze users will no longer be able to log in using a password, even if they have logged in with a password before.
