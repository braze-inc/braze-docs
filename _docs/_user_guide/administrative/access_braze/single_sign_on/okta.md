Okta connects any person with any application on any device. It's an enterprise-grade, identity management service, built for the cloud, but compatible with many on-premises applications. With Okta, IT can manage any employee's access to any application or device.

## Step 1: Configure Braze

### Step 1a: Log in to your Braze Account and Navigate to Security Settings
Log into your Braze account using an __admin account__.

Click on your user name, then select `Company Settings` from the dropdown menu. Next, select the `Security Settings` tab. Toggle the green `SAML SSO` switch to `ON` from the right side of the page.

### Step 1b: Edit SAML SSO Settings

From your Okta Admin Dashboard, you will be provided a `Target URL` (Login URL) and `x.509` certificate which you must input into your Braze account.

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| `SAML Name` | This will appear as the button text on the login screen. This is typically your IdP name, For example, "Okta". |
| `Target URL` | This is the Login URL provided by Okta Admin Dashboard.|
| `Certificate` | The `x.509` PEM encoded certificate is provided by your IdP. You must copy and paste it into this field. |

Select `Save Changes` at the bottom of the page once completed.

## Step 2: Enable the IdP-initiated Flow

Next, you must create your Braze API Key with `sso.saml.login` permission enabled.
- If you do not already have such a Braze API Key, one can be created by going to the `Developer Console` in `Settings`, then click `Create New API Key`.<br>From here, scroll down to the SSO section and check the `sso.saml.login` option and then __save__ the API Key.<br>

### Step 3a: Navigate to Okta

In Okta, select the `Sign On` tab for the Braze SAML app, then click `Edit`.

### Step 3b: Update Default Relay State

Enter the API key with `sso.saml.login` permission you made in Step 2, in the `Default Relay State` field.

__Save these new settings.__

{% alert tip %}
If you want your Braze account users to only sign in with SAML SSO, you can [restrict single sign-on authentication]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/single_sign_on/restriction/) from the `Company Settings` page.
{% endalert %}

## You should now be able to log into Braze using Okta!
