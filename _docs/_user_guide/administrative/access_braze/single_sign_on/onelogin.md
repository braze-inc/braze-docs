# OneLogin

> This article will walk you through how to configure Braze to use OneLogin for single sign-on.

[OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/) is a cloud identity platform that provides a comprehensive solution for managing user identities. OneLogin integrates with cloud and on-premise applications using SAML 2.0, for Single Sign-On (SSO), user provisioning, multi-factor authentication, and more.

## Requirements

Upon setup, you will be asked to provide a Sign-On URL and an Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL.  

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Braze Domain** | You will need your Braze domain to set up Braze within OneLogin. If your instance is `US-01`, you will need to input your dashboard URL into the OneLogin dashboard. <br> For example, if your dashboard URL is `https://dashboard-01.braze.com`, you need to input `dashboard-01.braze.com`.  |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}


## Service Provider (SP) Initiated Login within OneLogin

### Step 1: Configure the Braze App

1. Log into [OneLogin](https://app.onelogin.com/login). Click on `Administration`.
- ![onelogin_1]({% image_buster /assets/img/onelogin_1.png %})

2. Go to `Apps` > `Add Apps` in the top navigation bar. Search for `Braze` and select the Braze app.
- ![onelogin_2]({% image_buster /assets/img/onelogin_2.png %})

3. Save the Braze app to your Company.
- ![onelogin_3]({% image_buster /assets/img/onelogin_3.png %})

4. Once saved, go to `Configuration` and add your `Braze Domain`.
- ![onelogin_4]({% image_buster /assets/img/onelogin_4.png %})

5. Braze expects the SAML assertions in a [specific format][1]. Under `Parameters` the [attributes][1] supported by Braze should be pre-populated. Simply verify that this is correct.
- ![onelogin_5]({% image_buster /assets/img/onelogin_5.png %})

6. Copy the `Certificate` and `SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)` needed to set up the Braze dashboard from under the `SSO` tab.
- ![onelogin_6]({% image_buster /assets/img/onelogin_6.png %})

### Step 2: Configure OneLogin within Braze

Once you have set up Braze within your OneLogin, they will provide a Target URL (`SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)`) and `x.509` certificate which you will input into your Braze account.

After your Account Manager has enabled SAML SSO for your account, go to `Company Settings` > `Security Settings` and toggle the SAML SSO section to `ON`.

On this page, you, input:

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| `SAML Name` | This will appear as the button text on the login screen. This is typically your IdP name, like "OneLogin". |
| `Target URL` | This is the `SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)` URL provided by OneLogin.|
| `Certificate` | The `x.509` PEM encoded certificate is provided by your OneLogin. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

![Enable SAML SSO]({% image_buster /assets/img/samlsso.gif %})

## Create and Enable a Braze API Key for IdP Login (Optional)

To enable IdP initiated login, you will first need to create an API Key in `Developer Console` > `API Settings`.

![SSO Set Up]({% image_buster /assets/img/sso2.png %})

Input the generated API Key as the `RelayState` parameter within OneLogin under `Configuration`, which will be used to identify which company the user is trying to log into.

{% alert tip %}
If you want your Braze account users to only sign in with SAML SSO, you can [restrict single sign-on authentication]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/single_sign_on/restriction/) from the `Company Settings` page.
{% endalert %}
