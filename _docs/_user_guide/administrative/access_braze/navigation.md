# Braze navigation

> We're updating the Braze navigation to help you create and access your content more quickly and efficiently. To make this transition easier for you and your team, this guide covers what has changed and what you can expect next.

The new Braze navigation features a completely redesigned information architecture (how information is organized, grouped, and presented) to make each part of Braze more searchable and understandable.

Features are now organized into intuitive categories that are familiar and relevant to a marketer's workflow in Braze. Hover over a main section in the sidebar to open the submenu and view all available pages in that section.

Some pages have been renamed to better represent their contents. For a complete list of where features are now located, refer to the **Changes** tab in the [Sidebar](#sidebar) section of this article.

## Switch to the new navigation

You can turn on the new navigation at any time by selecting **Switch to new nav** in the global header.

![Global header of Braze with a button to switch to the new navigation.]({% image_buster /assets/img/navigation/global_header_switch.png %}){: style="max-width:70%"}

## What to expect next

You will still be able to switch back and forth between the new and old navigation until **January 2025**.

## What's changed

### App group rename

As part of our navigation and information architecture changes, we have renamed "app group" to "workspace". We recognize that the language "app group" doesn't reflect the way many users onboard, approach, and use the Braze platform. To better reflect the many use cases of Braze, "app group" is now "workspace".

If you're using our updated navigation, this change will appear throughout the platform.

### Quick links

Easily access the **Canvas**, **Campaigns**, and **Segments** pages with quick links available in the sidebar.
