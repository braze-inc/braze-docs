# Navigating Braze

Braze navigation is designed to help you efficiently access features and content across devices. Let’s explore how to make the most of it.

{% alert note %}
This update simplifies your experience by transitioning all users to a unified navigation. The option to switch between navigation versions is no longer available.
{% endalert %}

## Using the menu

The vertical menu structure keeps your most-used tools just a press away. Select a main menu item to reveal its options in a stacked vertical layout.

## Global search

The global search, located in the header, is your fastest way to find anything in Braze. Select the search bar, or press Ctrl + K on Windows or ⌘ + K on a Mac to jump directly there. 

![Global search open with no search terms entered, showing recently open pages.]({% image_buster /assets/img/navigation/search_recently_opened.png %})

The search understands synonyms for pages that have been renamed in our updated navigation. For example, it will find “Data Export” when you search for “Currents”, as that page has been renamed.

## Minimizing the side navigation

To reduce visual clutter and focus on your workspace, you can minimize the side navigation panel. Press **Minimize menu** to hide the navigation, which is especially helpful when working in Canvas to design user flows.

Even when minimized, you can hover over the icons to see tooltips with menu item names for quick access.

## Responsive navigation

The navigation adjusts seamlessly across device sizes. On smaller screens, the side navigation collapses automatically. Press <i class="fa-solid fa-bars" aria-label="Open navigation menu"></i> to open the menu when needed.

## Sharing feedback

You can share your feedback on topics like navigation, usability, accessibility, visual appeal, or anything else that matters to you. Open the **Support** menu in the global header and select **Share feedback** to send us your thoughts. Your input helps us improve Braze, and we value hearing from you!
