# Getting your account

If you are your company’s first Braze user and logging in for the first time, you will receive a welcome email from `@alerts.braze.com` asking you to confirm your email and log in on the first day of your contract.

Once you have confirmed your account you can add additional users in the Manage Users page of your dashboard. All users will receive an email asking them to confirm their account once they have been added.

For more on managing your company’s Braze users, check out the [Manage Your Braze Users]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/manage_your_braze_users/adding_users_to_your_dashboard/) section.

If you are not the first user on your company’s Braze account, reach out to your company’s Braze Account Administrator and ask them to create your account. You will then receive a welcome email from `@alerts.braze.com` asking you to confirm your email and log in.

# Logging in

Now that you’ve established where you need to log in, let’s talk about how to log in, whether it’s the first time or the millionth! If you are your company’s first user, follow the guidance detailed above. If not, feel free to log in after your company’s Braze Admin creates your account!

You can either log in from the [Braze.com](https://www.braze.com) home site, or just use your dashboard URL that corresponds to your specific Braze instance listed [here]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/braze_instances/). For your convenience, Braze now has several single sign on option such as [SAML SSO]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/single_sign_on/set_up/), [Azure Active Directory]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/single_sign_on/azure_ad/), [Okta]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/single_sign_on/okta/), and [OneLogin]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/single_sign_on/onelogin/).
