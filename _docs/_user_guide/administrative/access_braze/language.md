2. Choose your language from the list.

## Change your notification language settings

You can also choose to change your notification language. This is set separately from the dashboard language and will be used for email and other communications from Braze.

### Company administrators

Administrators can set the default language for communications to all users in their company:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Company Settings**.
2. For **Notification Language**, select a language.
3. Click **Save Changes**.

### Limited users

If you have limited permissions, your notification language is set to the default for your company. You can change this to set a different language than the one set by your administrator. This will affect any communications from Braze to you.

1. Select your profile and click **Manage your account**.
2. In the **Account Profile** section, select your **Notification Language**.
3. Click **Save Changes**.
