# Logging In

Now that you’ve established where you need to log in, let’s talk about how to log in, whether it’s the first time or the millionth! If you are your company’s first user, check out the Getting Your Account section. If not, feel free to log in after your company’s Braze Admin creates your account!

You can either log in from the Braze.com home site, or just use one of the URLs listed in the [Access Braze]({{ site.baseurl }}/administrative/access_braze/braze_instances/) section. For your convenience, Braze now has single sign on options for Okta!
