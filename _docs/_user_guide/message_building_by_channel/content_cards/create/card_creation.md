# Card creation

> You can choose when Braze evaluates audience eligibility and personalization for new Content Card campaigns and Canvas steps by specifying when the card is created.

## Prerequisites

To take advantage of this feature, you must upgrade to the following minimum SDK versions:

{% sdk_min_versions swift:5.2.0 android:23.0.0 web:4.2.0 %}

After upgrading the SDK, your mobile users must upgrade their app. You can filter your campaign or Canvas audience to only [target users on these minimum app versions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/ideas_and_strategies/new_features/#filtering-by-most-recent-app-versions).

## Overview

{% tabs %}
{% tab Campaign %}

You can choose when Braze creates a card on the **Delivery** step when creating a new [Content Card campaign]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/create/) with scheduled delivery.

![Content Card Controls section when editing the delivery of a scheduled Content Card.]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/card_creation.png %})

The following options are available:

- **At campaign launch:** The previous default behavior for Content Cards. Braze calculates audience eligibility and personalization when the campaign launches, then creates the card and stores it until the user opens your app. 
- **At first impression (recommended):** When the user next opens your app (that is, starts a new [session](https://www.braze.com/resources/articles/whats-an-app-session-anyway)), Braze determines which Content Cards the user is eligible for, templates any personalization like Liquid or Connected Content, then creates the card. This option will usually see better performance in card deliveries.

Regardless of your selected option, the Content Card expiration date countdown will begin when the campaign launches.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Canvas %}

You can choose when Braze creates a card on the **Messaging Channels** tab of a Content Card [Message step]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/message_step/).

![Content Card Controls section when editing the delivery of a scheduled Content Card.]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/card_creation_canvas.png %})

The following options are available:

- **At step entry:** The previous default behavior for Content Cards. Braze calculates audience eligibility when the user enters the Canvas step, then creates the card and stores it until the user opens your app.
- **At first impression (recommended):** Braze calculates audience eligibility when the user enters the Canvas step. When the user next opens your app (that is, starts a new [session](https://www.braze.com/resources/articles/whats-an-app-session-anyway)), Braze templates any personalization like Liquid or Connected Content, then creates the card. This option will see better performance in card deliveries and more up to date personalization.

Regardless of your selected option, the Content Card expiration date countdown will begin when the user enters the Canvas step.

{% alert tip %}
If you want anonymous users to see a Content Card in their very first session, use a campaign instead of a Canvas. This is because when an anonymous user enters a Canvas, their session has already started, so they won't get the Content Card until they start a new session.
{% endalert %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% alert note %}
For both options, after a card is created, Braze does not recalculate audience eligibility or personalization.
{% endalert %}

### Differences between creating cards at launch or entry versus at first impression

This section describes the main differences between card creation at campaign launch or step entry versus at first impression.

<p id="campaign_note"><sup>* This scenario only applies to campaigns, as Canvas audience is evaluated at Canvas entry, not at the step level.</sup></p>

## Considerations

### Changing card creation after launch

Braze recommends not changing how cards are created after a campaign has launched. Due to the differences in how Messages Sent is calculated between the two card creation types, changing how cards are created after the campaign has launched can affect the accuracy of your send volume.

### Potential processing time

We recommend that campaigns with large audiences select the option to create cards at first impression, as cards will be available much more quickly after the campaign is launched. Campaigns which are triggered on session start may also want to consider moving to create card at first impression (available through scheduled delivery) to realize performance improvements.

When cards are created at first impression, it may take 1â€“2 seconds for the cards to process. The length of this processing time depends on various factors, such as the card size and the complexity of the message templating options. For example, the processing time for cards using Connected Content will be at least as long as the Connected Content response time.

### Previous SDK versions

If a user's app is running a previous version of the SDK, they will still receive Content Cards sent with a specified card creation. However, cards will take longer to appear to these users, and may not appear until the next Content Card sync.
