# LINE subscription groups

> There are two subscription states for LINE users: subscribed and unsubscribed. LINE can have up to 100 subscription groups per workspace, with each subscription group connected to its own LINE channel.

| State | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Subscribed | The user followed the LINE channel from within their LINE app. Users are automatically subscribed when they follow after you've completed the integration steps. |
| Unsubscribed | The user didn't follow the LINE channel from within their LINE app, or the user explicitly unfollowed the LINE channel. <br><br> Users who unsubscribe from a LINE subscription group will no longer receive any LINE messages from sending channels that belong to the subscription group. |

## Setting a user's LINE subscription group

LINE hosts the users' subscription status. Braze processes the follow and unfollow events that update the subscription status.
