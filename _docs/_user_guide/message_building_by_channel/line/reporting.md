# LINE reporting

> After launching your campaign or Canvas, you can view key metrics on the campaign details page or Canvas analytics. This article covers where you can find those metrics and what they represent.

{% alert tip %}
Looking for definitions for the terms and metrics in your report? Refer to [Report metrics glossary]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/report_metrics/).
{% endalert %}

## Campaign analytics

In the **Campaign Analytics** tab, you can view your reports in a series of panels. You might see more or less than those listed in the sections below, but each has its purpose.

{% alert note %}
Open and click-related statistics for LINE are only calculated if more than 20 users perform the event on a given day.
{% endalert %}

### Campaign details

The **Campaign Details** panel shows a high-level overview of your LINE messages' performance.

Review this panel to see overall metrics such as the number of messages sent to the number of recipients, the primary conversion rate, and the total revenue generated by this message. You can also review delivery, audience, and conversion settings from this page.

#### Control groups

To measure the impact of an individual LINE message, you can add a [control group]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/testing/multivariant_testing/) to an A/B test. The top-level **Campaign Details** panel doesnâ€™t include metrics from the Control Group variant.

### LINE performance

The **LINE Performance** panel outlines how well your message has performed across various dimensions. The metrics in this panel vary depending on your chosen messaging channel, and whether or not you are running a multivariate test. You can click on the <i class="fa fa-eye preview-icon"></i> **Preview** icon to view your message for each variant or channel.

### Historical performance

The **Historical Performance** panel allows you to view the metrics from the **Message Performance** panel as a graph over time.
