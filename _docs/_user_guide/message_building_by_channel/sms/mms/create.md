# Creating an MMS campaign

> This article contains information specific to MMS composition, which is part of the SMS composer. For more detailed information about the SMS/MMS composer, refer to the [SMS composer]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/create/).

## MMS sending basics

### Select your subscription group

You must designate a subscription group with MMS enabled phone numbers to target (can be short or long codes).

### Input message body

Input PNG, JPEG, GIF, and VCF image types from the media library or specify a URL. Only one image is supported.

### Understand MMS sending

MMS are billed at a different rate versus text-only SMS, and not all carriers can accept MMS. In these cases, Twilio will automatically convert the MMS to an image link the user can click.

### Use contact cards

Contact cards (sometimes known as vCard or Virtual Contact Files (vcf)) are a standardized file format for sending business and contact information that can be easily imported into address books or contact books. These cards can be created [programmatically](https://www.twilio.com/blog/send-vcard-twilio-sms) and uploaded to the Braze media library or created through our built-in [contact card generator]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/mms/contact_card/).

## Creating an MMS message

Creating an MMS message requires your subscription group to be configured for MMS sending. This is indicated by seeing the MMS tag when selecting a subscription group. Upon selecting an MMS-enabled subscription group, you will have the ability to upload an image, reference an image URL, or include a contact card.

## Previewing an MMS message

Braze provides a preview of the image you have uploaded in the **Preview** panel of the message composer.

The ordering of SMS/MMS assets cannot be customized. The ordering is dependent on the phone receiving this message.
