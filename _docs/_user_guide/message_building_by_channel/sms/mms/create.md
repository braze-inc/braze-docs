# MMS message sending

> This page only contains information specific to MMS composition, which is part of the SMS composer. For more detailed information about the SMS/MMS composer, check the [SMS Composer][1].

## MMS sending basics

Sending MMS with Braze:

- **Select your subscription group**
  - You must designate a subscription group with MMS enabled phone numbers to target (can be short or long codes).<br><br>
- **Input message body**
  - Input PNG, JPG, GIF, and VCF image types from the media library or specify a URL.
  - Only 1 image supported<br><br>
- **Understand MMS sending**
  - MMS are billed at a different rate versus text-only SMS.
  - Not all carriers can accept MMS. In these cases, Twilio will automatically convert the MMS to an image link the user can click.

### Contact Cards

Contact Cards (sometimes known as vCard or Virtual Contact Files (vcf)) are a standardized file format for sending business and contact information that can be easily imported into address books or contact books. These cards can be created [programmatically](https://www.twilio.com/blog/send-vcard-twilio-sms) and uploaded to the Braze media library or created through our built-in [Contact Card generator]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/mms/contact_card/).

## Creating an MMS message

Creating an MMS message requires your Subscription Group to be configured for MMS sending. This is indicated by seeing the MMS tag when selecting a Subscription Group. Upon selecting an MMS-enabled Subscription Group, you will have the ability to upload an image, reference an image URL, or include a Contact Card.
