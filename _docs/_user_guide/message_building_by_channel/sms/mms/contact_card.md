# Contact Cards 

> Contact Cards (sometimes known as vCard or Virtual Contact Files (VCF)) are a standardized file format for sending business and contact information that can be easily imported into address books or contact books. 

Contact Cards can be created [programmatically](https://www.twilio.com/blog/send-vcard-twilio-sms) and uploaded to the Braze [media library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/media_library/#media-library) or created through our built-in Contact Card Generator. You can assign common properties to these cards, such as your company's name, phone number, address, email, and a small photo.

### Step 1: Assign name

Contact Cards can be created from the SMS and MMS composer. Select the **Contact Card Generator** tab to get started.

Next, you will be prompted to input your company name or nickname. This is the name that your users will see when they save the card. A 20 character limit is enforced to ensure the user can see your whole company name or alias in their contacts and messaging app.

### Step 2: Assign phone number

Select the subscription group and desired phone number from the available drop-down options. This number will be listed in your Contact Card and available on their phone to text to once saved.

Note that alphanumeric codes are not compatible with two-way messaging and are not supported for Contact Cards.

### Step 3: Optional fields

**Contact Card Contact Photo**<br>
You can upload an optional thumbnail contact photo for your Contact Card. We recommend a 240x240 JPEG or PNG image. Any high-resolution images uploaded will be resized to 240x240 to ensure the deliverability of your message, as MMS messages larger than 5MB may fail.

**Other Information**<br>
Other fields allow you to insert your name, subheader, address, and other contact information that your user may want to have handy.

### Step 4: Saving your contact card

Once you've input all the necessary fields, click **Generate Contact Card**, and it will be automatically attached to your campaign or Canvas. From here, you can add a message, test your Contact Card, and launch your campaign or Canvas.

The Contact card will also be saved in the [Media Library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/media_library/#media-library) to easily reuse in future campaigns and Canvases.

## Adding an existing contact card

To add an existing Contact Card, create a campaign or Canvas and select your desired subscription group. Next, an **Add Media** option will appear in the message composer window. Here, you can upload an existing Contact Card file or locate one through the media library.
