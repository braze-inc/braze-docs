# User Phone Numbers

> This article will discuss different topics around your users' or customers' phone numbers - if you're looking for information about your own numbers, please go to our article on [Short & Long Codes]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/onboarding_with_braze/sms_setup/short_and_long_codes/#short--long-codes).

Phone numbers are shown in the User Profile in local formats, but will not be in the format you use to import the number (`(724) 123 4567`).

## Importing Phone Numbers

You can import phone numbers by uploading a [CSV]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/user_data_collection/user_import/#csv) or via [API]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/#user-track-endpoint) to create a user.

### Formatting

As a best practice, the best way to import a phone number is in [`E.164`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format. However, Braze will attempt to interpret or convert any U.S. number to the best of our ability.

All U.S. numbers must be valid, 10-digit phone numbers with a valid area code. They can be input without the `+` and country code, as Braze will assume and map all valid, 10-digit phone numbers as U.S. numbers.

All international numbers should start with a `+`, followed by their country code and then the phone number. (e.g `+442071838750`)

However, to ensure accuracy in the event that you are sending to multiple regions with different country or area codes, it is recommended to use the `E.164` format, even for U.S.-based phone numbers.

You can see the differences between local number formatting as well as universal, `E.164` formatting in the table below:

| Country | Local | Country Code | `E.164` |
|---|---|---|---|
| USA | `4155552671` | 1 | `+14155552671` |
| UK | `2071838750` | 44 | `+442071838750` |
| Brazil | `1155256325` | 55 | `+551155256325` |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3 reset-td-br-4}

### Adding Users to SMS Subscription Groups

For a customer to receive an SMS message, they __must have a valid phone number and be opted-in to a Subscription Group__. Subscription Groups are tied to the SMS program you are running ([make sure you follow the legal laws for SMS and have recorded consent for each customer]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/sms_laws_and_regulations/)). For more information on SMS Subscription Groups, check out [our documentation][1].
