# Double opt-in process

You might find that some users who might send a text to your short or long code, won't yet be opted-in to your SMS subscription group. Regulations require that you obtain a userâ€™s explicit consent before you send them any promotional or informational messaging. We highly recommend implementing a double opt-in to ensure compliance.

We suggest setting a triggered entry in Canvas whenever there's an incoming event `sms_response_subscriptionGroupName_custom`. Refer to [Custom keyword messaging handling][1] for more information.

## Step 1: Create a webhook

We first suggest creating a webhook campaign that makes a request to the [subscription/status/set endpoint][SSSendpoint] to subscribe the user to that SMS subscription group.

## Step 2: Send an SMS campaign

Next, we recommend sending an SMS campaign a few seconds later, with clear call-to-actions along the lines of:

![SMS message with the text "Braze: Thanks for your interest in Deal Texts! Expect three messages a month! Reply YES to join, STOP to stop, HELP for help. Message and data rates may apply."][IMAGE]{: style="border: 0"}
