# Frequently asked questions

## How do I get access to the RCS feature in Braze? 

For access to this feature, reach out to your Braze customer success manager for more details as you need to have an RCS-verified sender and Message Credits.

### Do I need to have SMS to participate in this early access? 

No, but it's highly recommended because RCS is not as common as SMS yet. For example, if your RCS message can't be delivered (either because it's not supported by a specific carrier or not enabled on a user's device), Braze offers an SMS fallback option. In this case, if you don't have SMS, your message won't be delivered.

### What are the compliance requirements for RCS messages? 

The compliance requirements are similar to SMS messages (such as following the same opt-in and content requirements). We recommend you consult your legal team before sending RCS messages to your customers.

### I want to send RCS to a country not covered by Braze. Is this possible? 

It depends because Braze is rolling out country support in phases, starting with the countries that have the highest carrier coverage. Reach out to your Braze customer success manager for more information.

### Do I have to collect opt-in to start sending RCS messages to my customers? 

Yes, the RCS messaging channel requires collecting explicit opt-in before messaging your customers, similar to SMS.

### Can I send RCS messages to my SMS subscribed customers or do I need to collect opt-in for RCS specifically and rebuild my list? 

We recommend you consult your legal team before sending RCS messages, as the approach to consent and opt-in requirements may vary across different jurisdictions and organizations. RCS is an emerging and evolving channel, but the current industry guidance leans towards the understanding that you can send RCS if a customer has already opted into receiving SMS from your brand.

### Do I need a phone number to send RCS? How does the application process work? 

The RCS channel uses an RCS-verified sender to send messages, which differs from the traditional phone number-based sending of SMS and MMS. An RCS-verified sender is most similar to an alphanumeric sender, but supports two-way messaging and has the added benefit of indicating that your business has been vetted by the carriers, bolstering customer trust. 

All brands must go through an application process, guided by our SMS and RCS Operations team, before they can acquire an RCS-verified sender. This process is similar to a short code application process.

### How can I see my RCS Message Credits consumption?

During early access, work with your Braze customer success manager for regular updates about your Message Credits usage for RCS. The Message Usage dashboard only tracks SMS and WhatsApp credit usage and doesn't track RCS usage at this time.
