# Product messages

> Product messages empower you to send interactive WhatsApp messages that showcase products directly from your Meta catalog.

When you send a WhatsApp product message to a user, the user goes on the following customer journey:

1. The user receives your product or catalog message in WhatsApp.
2. The user adds products to their cart directly from WhatsApp.
3. The user taps **Place order** in WhatsApp.
4. Your website or app recieves the cart data from Braze and generates a checkout link.
5. The user is directed to your website or app to complete their checkout.

When users add items to their cart through catalog messages, Braze receives webhook data for follow-up actions.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
| --- | --- |

## Product message types

{% alert note %}
Enhance your product message experience with the integrated product selector, which is accessed during step 4 of [Setting up product messages](#setting-up-product-messages).
{% endalert %}

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Catalog messages %}

Catalog messages display your entire product catalog in an interactive format. They are available as [template and response messages](#building-a-product-message).

If you've enabled catalog permissions to Braze during [setup](#setting-up-product-messages), you can select which thumbnail is visible to users. 

{% alert note %}
You don't need to make additional product selections in Braze, as the catalog connection is managed by Meta and thus is inherited into your product catalog.
{% endalert %}


{% endtab %}
{% tab Multi-product messages %}

Multi-product messages highlight specific products from your catalog, with up to 30 highlighted items per message. They are available as [template and response messages](#building-a-product-message).

You can either select the products manually with IDs or, if you’ve enabled catalog permissions during [setup](#setting-up-product-messages), use the dropdown product selector.

{% alert important %}
There’s a known header display issue with multi-product message templates on Meta. Meta is aware of the issue and working on a fix.
{% endalert %}

{% endtab %}
{% tab Single product %}

Single product messages highlight one specific product from your product catalog. They are available as [response messages](#building-a-product-message).

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Setting up product messages

1. In the [Meta Commerce Manager](https://business.facebook.com/business/loginpage/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.facebook.com%2Fcommerce_manager%2F#), follow [Meta's instructions](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1275400645914358?id=725943027795860&ref=search_new_1) to create your Meta catalog. Make sure you’re in the same Meta Business Portfolio where your Braze-connected WhatsApp Business Accont resides.
2. Follow Meta's instructions to [connect your Meta catalog](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1953352334878186?id=2042840805783715) to your Braze-connected WhatsApp Business Account by assigning the "Manage Catalog" permission in Meta Business Manager. 

![Meta "Catalogs" page with an arrow pointing at the "Assign partner" button for the catalog called "sweeney_catalog".]({% image_buster /assets/img/whatsapp/meta_catalog.png %}){: style="max-width:90%;"}

Make sure to use the Braze Business Manager ID, `332231937299182`, as the partner business ID.

![Window to share a catalog with a partner that contains fields to enter a partner business ID and assign the permission "Manage catalog".]({% image_buster /assets/img/whatsapp/share_meta_catalog.png %}){: style="max-width:70%;"}

{: start="3"}
3. Select your Meta catalog settings. You must select **Show catalog icon in chat header** to send catalog messages.

![WhatsApp Manager settings page for the "Catalog_products" catalog.]({% image_buster /assets/img/whatsapp/meta_catalog_settings.png %}){: style="max-width:90%;"}

{: start="4"}
4. In Braze, go through the [embedded signup]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/overview/embedded_signup/) process to provide permissions. Be sure to select **all** the catalogs you want to provide permissions for. This will unlock the Braze integrated product selector.

{% alert tip %}
For best practices to follow when creating Meta catalogs, refer to [Tips for building a high-quality catalog in Commerce Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2086567618225367?id=725943027795860).
{% endalert %}

## Building a product message

You can build a product message by using a WhatsApp template message or response message.

{% tabs local %}
{% tab WhatsApp message template %}

1. In your Meta Business manager, go to **Message Templates**.
2. Select **Catalog** as a format, and then choose between **Catalog message** (displays full catalog) and **Multi-product catalog message** (highlights specific items).
3. In Braze, create a WhatsApp campaign or Canvas Message step.
4. Select the subscription group that matches where you submitted the template.
5. Select **WhatsApp Template Message**.
6. Select the template you’d like to use.
    - If you select a multi-product template, provide the section title and content IDs for the products to highlight. You can either copy the Content ID directly from your Meta Commerce Manager or, if you enabled the permissions for the integrated product selector, select the items.

![Item list with fields to enter your section titles and content ID.]({% image_buster /assets/img/whatsapp/multi_product_template.png %}){: style="max-width:60%;"}

![Item list with dropdown of items to select from.]({% image_buster /assets/img/whatsapp/content_id_items.png %}){: style="max-width:60%;"}

{: start="7"}
7. Continue building your message.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Response message %}

1. In Braze, create a WhatsApp campaign or Canvas Message step.
2. Select a subscription group.
3. Select **Response Message**.
4. Select **Meta Product Messages**.

![Options to select a message type and response message layout, with "Response Message" and "Meta Product Messages" highlighted.]({% image_buster /assets/img/whatsapp/response_message_layouts.png %}){: style="max-width:90%;"}

{: start="5"}
5. Select the [message type](#product-message-types) you'd like to use.

![Mesage layout selection of "Multi-product".]({% image_buster /assets/img/whatsapp/multi-product_message_layout.png %}){: style="max-width:90%;"}

{: start="6"}
6. Continue building your message.

![Example Meta product message with filled out information for products.]({% image_buster /assets/img/whatsapp/example_response_message.png %}){: style="max-width:90%;"}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Managing products

### Accessing Commerce Manager

In your Meta Business Manager, go to **Commerce Manager** and select your organization. Here, you can manage your catalog assets, such as:
- Create new catalogs
- Add products to existing catalogs
- Update product information
- Remove discontinued items

{% alert important %}
If you remove referenced products from your catalog, the associated messages will fail to send.
{% endalert %}

## Receiving inbound product questions 

Users can respond to your product or catalog message with product questions. These arrive as inbound messages, which can then be sorted with an [Action Path]({{site.baseurl}}/action_paths/). 

Additionally, Braze extracts the product ID and catalog ID from these questions, so if you wish to automate responses or send questions to another team (such as customer support), you can include those details. For example, you could personalize responses with the WhatsApp properties of `inbound_product_id` or `inbound_catalog_id`.

!["Add Personalization" window with a personalization type of "WhatsApp Properties" and a highlighted attribute of "inbound_product_id".]({% image_buster /assets/img/whatsapp/inbound_product_questions.png %}){: style="max-width:60%;"}

## Checkout: Cart processing and webhooks

When users interact with your WhatsApp product messages, they can browse products and add items to their cart. However, currently there is no built-in checkout functionality for shipping information or payment processing. Instead, we encourage you to create a cart within your own app or website and direct users to that cart using a custom link.

### Considerations

- **No in-app checkout:** Users can't complete purchases directly within WhatsApp. All transactions must be redirected to your website or app.
- **Custom link required:** You need to create a custom link that directs users to their cart on your platform.
- **Manual setup:** The setup process requires manual configuration of your cart and messaging workflows.

{% alert note %}
We currently don't support payments directly occurring in WhatsApp, and future support will be country-specific (currently, Meta offers it only for companies based in and working directly with users in India, Brazil, and Singapore).
{% endalert %}

### Setting up cart event triggers

When a customer places an order in WhatsApp, Braze automatically:
1. Receives the cart contents from WhatsApp (product IDs, quantities, and other order data).
2. Creates an `ecommerce.cart_update` eCommerce event with all relevant data, including `source = whats_app`.
3. Triggers a response, allowing you to set up automated campaigns to respond to the order.

The `ecommerce.cart_update` eCommerce event only appears listed in Braze after an event has been sent, which can be done by generating a test product message from Braze and submitting a cart event.
The cart event includes:

- **Cart ID:** Unique identifier for the cart
- **Products:** List of items with product IDs, quantities, and prices
- **Total Value:** Sum of all items
- **Currency:** The cart's currency
- **Source:** Marked as "whats_app"
- **Metadata:** Additional data like catalog ID and message text

You can find additional Braze cart event information in [Types of eCommerce recommended events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/custom_data/recommended_events/ecommerce_events#types-of-ecommerce-recommended-events).

### Setting up a triggered response

1. Create a custom event trigger for `ecommerce.cart_updated`.
2. Add a property filter for `source = "whats_app"`.

![Canvas step for an `ecommerce.cart_updated` custom event trigger with the basic property of "source" equaling `whats_app`.]({% image_buster /assets/img/whatsapp/product_message_canvas_step.png %})

{: start="3"}
3. Configure follow-up actions based on cart data.

### Recommended checkout implementations 

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Simple Liquid-based cart links %}

Use Liquid to build cart URLs directly in your response message. This is best if you have consistent product IDs between WhatsApp and your eCommerce platform.

#### Example Liquid

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% assign cart_link = "http://alejandro-test-new.myshopify.com/cart/" %}
{% for product in event_properties.products %}
 {% assign variant_id = product.product_id %}
 {% assign quantity = product.quantity %}
 {% if forloop.first %}
   {% assign cart_link = cart_link | append: variant_id | append: ":" | append: quantity %}
 {% else %}
   {% assign cart_link = cart_link | append: "," | append: variant_id | append: ":" | append: quantity %}
 {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{{ cart_link }}
```
{% endraw %}

#### Setup

1. Create a WhatsApp response message campaign with the trigger of an `ecommerce.cart_update` eCommerce event.
2. Create a subsequent message with the cart URL.
3. Build your cart URL with Liquid. If you use Shopify, you can [create a cart permalink](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/checkout/create-cart-permalinks) with the prior example Liquid.

![Diagram showing the checkout experience workflow for a Liquid-generated cart: Meta sends an order received message to Braze, which triggers an action-based trigger then creates a message with a cart link, which then sends a WhatsApp message.]({% image_buster /assets/img/whatsapp/liquid_generated_cart_link_checkout.png %})

{% endtab %}
{% tab Connected Content %}

Make an API call to your eCommerce system to generate a personalized checkout URL. This is best if you needi dynamic cart URL generation or complex product mapping.

#### Setup

1. Create a webhook campaign or Canvas step triggered by the [`ecommerce.cart_update`]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/custom_data/recommended_events/ecommerce_events/?tab=ecommerce.cart_updated) eCommerce event, which will send the cart data to your eCommerce system.
2. Create a WhatsApp campaign or Canvas Message step triggered by the same eCommerce event to send a WhatsApp response message with the cart URL to the user. Follow the direction in the subsequent response message to use [Connected Content]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/connected_content).

![Diagram showing the checkout experience workflow for a Connected Content call: Meta sends an order received message to Braze, which has back-and-forth calls with an eCommerce platform, then sends a WhatsApp message.]({% image_buster /assets/img/whatsapp/connected_content_checkout.png %})

{% endtab %}
{% tab Webhook and custom events %}

Use webhooks to send cart data to your system, then trigger follow-up messages through custom events. This is best for complex integrations requiring extensive cart processing or multi-step workflows.

#### Setup

Create a webhook campaign or Canvas step triggered by the `ecommerce.cart_update` eCommerce event, which will send the cart data to your eCommerce system. Your API will then:
1. Receive cart data
2. Create a cart in your system
3. Generate the checkout URL
4. Send a `checkout_started` event to Braze, triggering your WhatsApp message to send with the checkout link

![Diagram showing the checkout experience workflow for webhooks and custom events: Meta sends an order received message to Braze, which has back-and-forth calls with an eCommerce platform, then sends a WhatsApp message with the cart URL.]({% image_buster /assets/img/whatsapp/webhooks_custom_events_checkout.png %})

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Testing and validation

### Test message requirements

Cart functionality carries over between test messages, but processing of the inbound result doesn't carry over.

### Message preview

- Product images and details are pulled from your Meta catalog.
- Interactive preview shows placeholders until integration is complete.

### Error codes 

- If a product ID doesn't exist in the catalog, you’ll receive the error `product not found for product_retailer_id, fake-product-id, in catalog_id, 1903196950214359`.
- If a catalog is disconnected from the WABA, you'll receive the error `Check if catalog is linked to the WhatsApp Business Account and the catalog is enabled in the WhatsApp Commerce Settings`.
