# WhatsApp phone number migration

> Migrate your WhatsApp phone number between WhatsApp Business Accounts by using Meta's Embedded Signup.

## Prerequisites

Your phone number must meet Meta's requirements to be eligible for migration:

- Your Meta Business Account is verified.
- Your existing WhatsApp Business Account is approved.
- Your existing WhatsApp Business Account has a valid payment method in **Payment Settings**.
- Your business phone number has two-step verification turned off. If you own your WhatsApp Business Account, you can turn off two-step verification on their number in the WhatsApp Manager. Otherwise, you must ask your Solution Provider to turn it off for you.

For information on migrating your WhatsApp phone number, see Meta's documentation for [Migrating phone numbers between WhatsApp Business Accounts via Embedded Signup](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/guides/migrate-phone-to-different-waba/).
