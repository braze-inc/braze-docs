# Frequently asked questions

> This article provides answers to some frequently asked questions about the push channel.

### What happens when multiple users log into a single device?

When a user logs out of a device or website, they will remain reachable by push until another user logs in. At that point, the push token is reassigned to the new user. This is because each device can only have one active push subscription per app or website.

When a push token is reassigned, the change is reflected in the user profile's **Push Changelog**. You can find this by going to the **Engagement** tab in the user profile.

### Why doesn't an opted-in user have a push token?

This can happen if the userâ€™s push token was reassigned to someone else who used the same device.

1. Go to the **Push Changelog** in the **Engagement** tab of the affected user's profile.
2. Look for a message that says the push token was moved to another user.
3. Copy the push token and paste into the user search bar. 
4. If the push token still exists, you'll be directed to the user who most recently logged in on the device.

If you want the push token reassigned to the original user:

1. Have the original user log into the profile with the missing push token.
2. Trigger a new push send. This will move the token back to the account if they still have push enabled on the device level.

### What if a user's push token no longer exists?

If a user's push token doesn't exist, check the user's profile for other accounts using the same device. The push token should be in one of those, and the associated account should have a more recent session time than the original.
