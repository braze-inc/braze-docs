# Push Stories

> This reference article covers what Push Stories are, how to create one, as well as some frequently asked questions.

Push Stories are a new type of push notification introduced by Braze. This feature takes the photo carousel functionality popularized in Instagram and Facebook and allows marketers to create a carousel of pages within a push that tells a rich, cohesive story. These pages consist of an image, click action, title, and description. Your users can swipe through these pages and view the storyâ€”as told by you.

| Android Example (Expanded) | IOS Example (Expanded) |
| :-----: | :----------: |
| ![][1] | ![][2] |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

{% alert note %}
On iOS SDK versions 3.13.0+, due to a change in how the SDK downloads images, a thumbnail of the first image will not show on the condensed view of the push. Ensure that your message copy prompts users to expand the push to see the images.
{% endalert %}

## Prerequisites

The following SDK versions are required to receive Push Stories:

{% sdk_min_versions ios:3.2.0 android:2.2.0 %}


## How to use Push Stories

![][6]{: style="float:right;max-width:50%;margin-left:15px;margin-bottom:15px;"}

To use Push Stories, create a [push campaign]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/push/creating_a_push_message/) and select **Push Stories** as your **Notification Type**.

### Push Story composer

To create a page, perform the following steps:

1. Click **Manage Pages** from the main composer.
    <br><br>![][4]{: style="max-width:70%"}<br><br>
2. Insert an image for each page, along with the click behavior for that image.
3. If desired, add a **Title** and **Description** for each page. If you use a title and description for one page, they must be inserted for all pages.

The previews will be reflected and are interactive.

{% alert important %}
If you are pulling in images with [Connected Content]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/connected_content/about_connected_content/#about-connected-content), ensure that your image URL begins with `https://`. Using `http://` will crash your app.
{% endalert %}

### Push Story segmentation

When you create a campaign or Canvas, you can filter which users you want to target based on whether they have clicked on a Push Story page. Then, select the campaign and the page you want to use to target your users.

### Push Stories analytics

The analytics will look very similar to the current analytics section for push notifications. For Push Stories analytics, you can open the **Direct Opens** metric to view the clicks per page.

## Troubleshooting

### I sent myself a Push Story on iOS but didn't receive the notification

Apple has specific rules in place that will prevent certain types of notifications from being sent to a device based on a number of different factors. This includes evaluating the customers' data plan, notification size, and the customers' storage capacity. As a result, sometimes no notification will be sent to your customers.

These are limitations imposed by Apple that should be considered when designing your Push Story.

### I sent myself a Push Story on iOS but saw the condensed view instead

In certain situations where all the pages do not load, for example, due to a loss of data connection, the Push Story will only show the condensed notification.
