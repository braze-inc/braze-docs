# Locales in messages

> After adding locales to your workspace, you can target users in different languages all within a single push notification.

Multi-language support and locales in messages are currently in early access. Contact your Braze account manager if youâ€™re interested in participating in this early access.

## Using locales

To use locales in your messaging, compose a push campaign or Canvas, then complete the following:

1. Add translation tags {% raw %}`{% translation id1%}` and `{% endtranslation %}`{% endraw %} to wrap all text, image, or link URLs to be translated. Each translation ID (`id1`) must be unique.

![Push notification composer with translation tags added to the title and message fields.]({% image_buster /assets/img/multi-language_support/push_translation_tags.png %})

{: start="2"}
2. Save your message as a draft.
3. Select **Manage language** and add your locales for the message using the dropdown.
4. Select **Download template**, then fill in the translations within the CSV template.

![]({% image_buster /assets/img/multi-language_support/translation_csv_example.png %})

{: start="5"}
5. To upload the completed CSV template, select **Upload translations**. 

![The "Multi-language messages" window with two locales selected and buttons to download a template or upload translations.]({% image_buster /assets/img/multi-language_support/upload_translation.png %})

Any changes to the IDs or locales in the CSV file will not automatically update in your message. To update the translations, update the CSV file and re-upload the file.

{% alert tip %}
Check out our [Translation API]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/translations) to manage and update translations in your campaigns and Canvases.
