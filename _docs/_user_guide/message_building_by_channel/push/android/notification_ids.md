# Notification IDs

> A notification ID can be assigned to a push notification when you want the option to group or replace it with an updated version once it’s been issued.

To assign a notification ID, navigate to the composition page of the push you’d like to add the ID to select the **Settings** tab. Enter an integer in the **Notification ID** section. To update this notification once you’ve issued it, send another notification with the same ID that you used previously.

![notificationids][1]{: style="max-width:80%;" }
