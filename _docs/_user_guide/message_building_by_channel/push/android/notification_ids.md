# Notification IDs

> A notification ID can be assigned to a push notification when you want the option to group or replace it with an updated version once it’s been issued.

To do this, navigate to the composition page of the push you’d like to add the ID to and enter an integer in the Notification ID section.
To update this notification once you’ve issued it, send another notification with the same ID that you used previously.
