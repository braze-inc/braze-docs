# In-app message editor blocks

> Editor blocks are the various blocks available in the **Drag-And-Drop Editor** under the **Build** section. This section includes a series of tiles that represent the different kinds of content you can use in your message.

To use them, drag an editor block inside a column. It will auto-adjust to the column width. Each editor block has its own settings, such as granular control on padding. The right-side panel automatically switches to a property panel for the selected content element.

## Types

The following table describes how you can use each editor block type.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Title | Enters a title text into the message |
| Paragraph | Enters a paragraph text into the message |
| Image | Inserts an image from the media library |
| Button | Adds a standard button. Properties for this block allow for editing, setting links, and logging analytics. |
| Spacer | Adds space or padding between other blocks. |
| Custom Code (early access) | Inserts raw HTML, CSS, and JS.  |
