# Product announcement

> Use the in-app message drag-and-drop editor to boost awareness of new product launches.

## Creating a product announcement

### Step 1: Choose your template

When creating a drag-and-drop in-app message, select **Product announcement** for your template, then select **Build message**. This template is supported for both mobile apps and web browsers.

### Step 2: Set up your message styles

{% multi_lang_include drag_and_drop/templates.md section='message style' %}

### Step 3: Customize your button component

To get started building your product announcement, select the button component in the editor. Then, use the side menu to select where users are taken when they select the button. By default, the template closes the message, but you can choose to navigate to a specific page in your app (such as the page of the product that is featured in your announcement).

You can also add additional messages to your product announcement in the **Pages** section, then link them together sequentially. For example, you can put together a sequence of messages that briefly describe the product's capabilities and end with button that takes users to the product page. Learn how to do that in [Connect pages together]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/drag_and_drop/create/?tab=adding%20pages#step-3a-connect-pages-together).

### Step 4: Style your message

Customize the look and feel of your product announcement using the drag-and-drop [in-app message components]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/drag_and_drop/style_settings/#message-components).
