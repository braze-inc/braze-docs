# Onboarding flow

> Use the **Onboarding flow** in-app message template to collect user attributes, insights, and preferences that power your campaign strategy. 

{% multi_lang_include drag_and_drop/templates.md section='SDK requirements' %}

## Creating an onboarding flow

### Step 1: Choose your template

When creating a drag-and-drop in-app message, select **Onboarding flow** for your template, then select **Build message**. This template is supported for both mobile apps and web browsers.

### Step 2: Set up your message styles

{% multi_lang_include drag_and_drop/templates.md section='message style' %}

### Step 3: Customize the order of your onboarding flow

To get started building your onboarding flow, use the **Pages** section to add or delete messages to your flow. After you have your desired number of messages, select the buttons on each page. Then, use the side menu to select where users go when they select the buttonâ€”whether they exit the flow or go to the next message.

Check that your messages are connected in sequential order so that users move through the flow correctly. For steps on how to do so, check out [Connect pages together]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/drag_and_drop/create/?tab=adding%20pages#step-3a-connect-pages-together).

### Step 4: Style your message

Customize the look and feel of your onboarding flow using the drag-and-drop [in-app message components][3].
