# Modal in-app messages

> Modals appear in the center of the device's screen with a screen overlay that helps it stand out from your app in the background. These are perfect for not-so-subtly suggesting that your user take advantage of a sale or giveaway.

## Image specifications

On a tablet or desktop browser, a modal in-app message will still sit in the center of the app screen as shown in the following screenshot.
