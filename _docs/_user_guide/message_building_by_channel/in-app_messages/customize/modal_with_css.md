# Modal with CSS (web only) {#web-modal-css}

If you choose to use a web-only Web Modal with CSS message, you can apply your own template or write your own CSS in the provided space. This space is already pre-filled with the CSS shown in your message preview, but feel free to adjust it slightly to meet your needs.

If you choose to apply your own template, click **Apply Template** and choose from the in-app message template gallery. If you don't have any options, you can upload a [CSS Template]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/customize/color_profiles_and_css/#in-app-message-templates) using the CSS Template builder.
