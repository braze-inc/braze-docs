# Video in in-app messages {#video}

To play a video in an HTML in-app message, include the following `<video>` element in your HTML, and replace the video names with your file's name (or the remote asset's URL).

To use a local video asset, be sure to include this file when uploading assets to your campaign.

To support iOS devices, you must include the `playsinline` attribute since full screen playback is not supported at this time.

{% alert note %}
iOS does not support autoplay by default. To update this default option, you can modify the [`ABKInAppMessageHTMLViewController`](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/blob/master/AppboyUI/ABKInAppMessage/ViewControllers/ABKInAppMessageHTMLViewController.m)
{% endalert %}

To embed video and other HTML5 content in HTML in-app messages on Android, hardware acceleration is required to be enabled in the Activity where the in-app message is displayed. For more information, refer to the [Android developer guide]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/in-app_messaging/customization/youtube_in_html/).

You can find other possible `<video>` options on [MDN Web Docs][9]

```html
<video class="video" autoplay muted playsinline controls>
  <source src="https://video-provider.com/YOUR_VIDEO_FILE.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="https://video-provider.com/YOUR_VIDEO_FILE.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  Your device does not support playing this video.
</video>
```

{% alert warning %}
Full screen videos will not render correctly on iOS and are not supported at this time. You must include the `playsinline` attribute to show the video within the HTML message instead.
{% endalert %}
