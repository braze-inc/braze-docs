# In-app message testing

> It is extremely important to always test your in-app messages before sending your campaigns. Our preview and testing capabilities offer two ways to take a look at your in-app messages. You can preview your message, to help you visualize as you compose it, as well as send a test message to your or a specific user's device. We recommend you take advantage of both.

## Preview

You can preview your in-app message as you compose it. This should help you visualize what your final message will look like from your user's perspective.

{% alert warning %}
In **Preview**, the view of your message might not be identical to its actual rendering on the user's device. We always recommend sending a test message to a device to ensure that your media, copy, personalization, and custom attributes generate correctly.
{% endalert %}

### In-app message generation preview

Preview what your message will look like to a random user, a specific user, or a customized userâ€”the latter two are especially useful if your message contains personalization or multiple languages. You can also preview messages for either mobile devices or tablets to get a better idea of what users will experience.

Braze has three generations of in-app messages available. You can fine-tune to which devices your messages should be sent, based on which Generation they support.

## Test

{% alert warning %}
To send a test to either [Content Test Groups]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/developer_console/internal_groups_tab/#content-test-groups) or individual users, push must be enabled on your test devices before sending. <br><br>For example, you must have push enabled on your iOS device in order to tap the notification before the test message displays.
{% endalert %}

### Preview message as user

You can also preview messages from the **Test** tab, as though you were a user. You can select a specific user, a random user, or create a custom user.

![Test tab when building an in-app message. "Preview message as user" is set to "Custom User" with available profile fields appearing as configurable options.]({% image_buster /assets/img/iam-user-preview.png %})

### Test checklist

- Do the images and media show up and act as expected?
- Does the Liquid function as expected? Have you accounted for a [default attribute value]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/conditional_logic/#accounting-for-null-attribute-values) in the event that the Liquid returns no information?
- Is your copy clear, concise, and correct?
- Do your buttons direct the user where they should go?

## Accessibility Scanner

![Accessibility scan results]({% image_buster /assets/img/Accessibilty_Scanner_IAM.png %})

### Overview
To support accessibility best practices, Braze offers an Accessibility Scanner that automatically reviews the HTML content of Custom HTML messages. This tool is designed to assist with identifying common accessibility issues, making it easier to work toward compliance with modern standards.

### How It Works
When a Custom HTML message is created, the Accessibility Scanner analyzes the message body and checks it against a set of accessibility rules derived from the WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines. It highlights known issues and provides:

- The HTML element(s) violated
- A description of the rule violation
- Link to learn more about the violation, potentially includuing guidance on how to address the issue

### Important Notes
- Not Comprehensive: The Accessibility Scanner is intended as a helpful diagnostic tool, not a complete accessibility audit. It may not catch every possible issue.
- For Informational Use: Results should be used as a starting point. We recommend validating your messages with full accessibility audits using tools like axe DevTools or engaging with accessibility specialists as needed.
- Best for HTML Messages: This scanner currently only runs on Custom HTML message bodies and does not evaluate content generated through drag-and-drop or WYSIWYG editors.
