> In-app messages are good for a lot of things. They're content rich and have a lower sense of urgency, as these messages don't deliver outside of the user's app and won't intrude on their home screen. In-app messages exist within your app (hence the name), come with context, and are almost never unwelcome! They're always delivered when the user is active within your app.

To see examples of in-app messages, check out our [Case Studies](https://www.braze.com/customers).

## Potential use cases

With the rich level of content offered by in-app messages, you can leverage this channel for a variety of use cases:

| Use case | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Push priming | Run a [push priming]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/push/best_practices/push_primer_messages/) campaign using a rich in-app message to show your customers the benefit of opting into push for your app or site, and present them with a prompt to grant push permission.
| Sales and promotions | Use modal in-app messages to greet customers with visually appealing media containing static promotion codes or offers. Incentivize them to make purchases or conversions when they otherwise wouldn't have. |
| Encouraging feature adoption | Encourage customers to use other parts of your app or take advantage of a service. |
| Highly personalized campaigns | Place in-app messages as the first thing your customers see when they enter your app or site. Add in some Braze personalization features, such as [Connected Content]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/connected_content/), to compel users to take action and therefore make your outreach more effective.

## Standard message types

The following tabs show what it looks like for your users to open one of our standard in-app message types—slide-up, modal, and fullscreen in-app messages.

{% tabs %}
{% tab Slideup %}

Slide-up messages typically appear at the top and bottom of the app screen (you can set this when you create your message). These are great for alerting your users about new terms of service, cookies, and other snippets of information.

<br>

{% endtab %}
{% tab Modal %}

Modals appear in the center of the device's screen with a screen overlay that helps it stand out from your app in the background. These are perfect for not-so-subtly suggesting that your user take advantage of a sale or giveaway.

<br>

{% endtab %}
{% tab Fullscreen %}

Fullscreen messages are exactly what you'd expect—they take up the whole screen of the device! This message type is great when you really need your user's attention, like for mandatory app updates.

![Fullscreen in-app message taking over an app screen. The fullscreen message includes a large image, header, message body, and two buttons.]({% image_buster /assets/img/full-screen-behavior.gif %}){: style="border:0px;"}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

In addition to these out-of-the box message templates, you can also further customize your messaging using custom HTML in-app messages, web modals with CSS, or web email capture forms.
