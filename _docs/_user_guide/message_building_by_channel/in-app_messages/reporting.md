## In-App Message Analytics Glossary

{% comment %}
Reporting in Canvas

In Canvas, you'll see in-app message performance mapped onto the Canvas you've created. You can use the control panel at the top of the page to uncheck other messaging types and only view the in-app messages in your Canvas.

Campaigns will deliver your reports in a series of blocks. You may see more or less than those listed in the tabs below, but each has their own useful purpose.
