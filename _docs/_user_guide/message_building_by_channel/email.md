# Use Cases {#email-use-cases}

- **Re-engagement:** Because email can reach users outside of the app, including those who have not installed the app, emails are well-suited for re-engagement.
- **Onboarding:** Email campaigns are also useful for onboarding new users and encouraging them to turn on push notifications or share the app via social networks.
- **Rich Messages:** For content that requires more than a simple push or slide, emails allow for rich and dynamic HTML messages.
- **Multimedia:** Using email allows for the placement of multimedia content like videos and images that engage users.
- **Newsletters:** Emails are convenient for sending monthly/weekly newsletters to maintain user engagement.
- **Transactions:** Transactional emails notify users of recent purchases and deliver important product and shipping information.
