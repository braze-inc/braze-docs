# Creating an email template

> The Braze dashboard has an email template editor that allows you to create custom-tailored, eye-catching emails and save them for later use in campaigns. You can also upload your own [HTML email template]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/templates/html_email_template/).

## Step 1: Navigate to the email template editor

Go to **Templates** > **Email Templates**.

{% alert note %}
If you are using the [older navigation]({{site.baseurl}}/navigation), this page is located at **Engagement** > **Templates & Media** > **Email Templates**.
{% endalert %}

## Step 2: Select your editing experience 

Select between **Drag-And-Drop Editor** or **HTML Editor** for your editing experience. 

Next, you can choose from predesigned Braze templates, create a new template, or edit an existing template (plain or [mobile responsive][8]).

{% alert note %}
Any existing custom HTML templates will need to be re-created using the drag-and-drop editor.
{% endalert %}

## Step 3: Customize your template

After selecting your editor experience, this is your opportunity to get creative with customizing your email template. You can use HTML to create and emulate your branding in the HTML editor, or include a variety of [creative details]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/drag_and_drop/overview/#creative-details) in the drag-and-drop editor.

### Including an unsubscribe link

As you design your email template, if you do not include an unsubscribe link, Braze will prompt you to add this in your email as it’s required by law on all marketing emails. You can add this unsubscribe link as a footer at the bottom of your emails by using the Liquid tag {% raw %}``${email_footer}``{% endraw %}, or by [customizing the footer]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/managing_user_subscriptions/#custom-footer) in your template.

## Step 4: Check for email errors

Email errors are presented on the **Compose** tab of the message workflow. Errors prevent you from progressing forward. "Warnings" indicate reminders to help you follow best practices. Depending on your business, you might choose to ignore them.

![Errors and warnings list from an example email.][1]{: style="float:right;max-width:40%;margin-left:15px;"}

Here's a list of errors that are accounted for in our editor:

- Incorrect Liquid syntax
- [Email bodies larger than 400kb; bodies are highly recommended to be less than 102kb][7]
- Templates without an unsubscribe link
- Emails with a blank **Body** or **Subject**
- Emails with no unsubscribe link

## Step 5: Preview and test your message

After you finish composing your template, you can test it before sending it out.

From the bottom of the overview screen, click **Preview and Test**. Here, you can preview how your email will appear in a customer's inbox. With **Preview as User** selected, you can preview your email as a random user, select a specific user, or create a custom user. This allows you to test that your Connected Content and personalization calls are working as they should.

You can also switch between desktop, mobile, and plaintext views to get a sense of how your message will appear in different contexts.

When you're ready for a final check, select **Test Send** and send a test message to yourself or a group of content testers to ensure that your email displays properly on a variety of devices and email clients.

If you see any issues with your template or want to make any changes, click **Edit Email** to return to the editor.

## Step 6: Save your template

Be sure to save your template by clicking **Save Template**. You're now ready to use this template in any campaign or Canvas component you choose. To access your template, select the editing experience you built it with, and then select it from the list of available templates.

{% alert note %}
If you make any edits to an existing template, those changes will not be reflected in campaigns created using previous versions of that template.
{% endalert %}

### Managing your templates

As you create more email templates, you can [duplicate]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/managing_templates/#duplicate-templates) and [archive]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/managing_templates/#archive-templates) email templates. Learn more about creating and managing your library of templates and creative content in [Templates and Media]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/).

### Using your templates in API campaigns

To use your email for an API campaign, you need an `email_template_id`, which can be found at the bottom of any email template created in Braze.

### Commenting on email templates

You can collaborate and comment on email templates in the drag-and-drop editor. 

1. Click the Content Block or row in the email body that you’d like to comment on.
2. Select the <i class="fas fa-comment"></i> comment icon.
3. Enter your comment in the sidebar, then click **Submit**.
4. After entering your comments, click **Done**.
5. Click **Save Template** to save your comments.

After your template is saved, users can see icons over unaddressed comments. Select **Resolve** to resolve these comments.
