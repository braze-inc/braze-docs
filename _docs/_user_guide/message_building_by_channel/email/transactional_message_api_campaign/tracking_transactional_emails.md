# Tracking transactional emails

> This page describes how to set up real-time tracking for [transactional email campaigns][1]. For more information about the endpoint itself, refer to [Send transactional emails using API-triggered delivery][2].

When you send transactional emails—like order confirmations or password resets—it’s essential to know whether they reach your customers. With Braze transactional HTTP event postbacks, you’ll get real-time insights into the status of every transactional email, so you can act quickly if there’s an issue.

Use this feature to:

- **Monitor your emails in real-time:** Immediately see if messages are sent, processed, delivered, or encounter issues.
- **Respond proactively:** Retry messages, switch to another channel like SMS, or use fallback systems to make sure your communications are delivered.
