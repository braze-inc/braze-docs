# Drag & Drop Editor Blocks

Editor blocks are the various blocks available in the Drag & Drop Editor under the 'Content' section.  This section includes a series of tiles that represent the different kinds of content you can use in your message. More will become available in the future.

To use them, drag one inside a column. It will auto-adjust to the column width.  Every content block has its owns settings, such as granular control on padding. The right-side panel automatically switches to a property panel for the selected content element.

## Block types

{% alert tip %}
_Note about Auto Width_
Automatic image resizing picks the best size for the image based on a combination of image width and available space in the layout:
- Large images, wider than the available space, will be set at 100% width and will keep this ratio on mobile, using the entire device display width.
- Small images, smaller than the available space, will use the image's natural size to avoid distortion effects or blurry pics.
