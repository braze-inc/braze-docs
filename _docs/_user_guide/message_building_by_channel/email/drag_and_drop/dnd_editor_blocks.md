# Editor blocks

> This reference article lists the types of editor blocks and their customizable properties. These blocks are available in the drag-and-drop editor under the **Content** section.

To use an editor block, drag an editor block inside a column in the drag-and-drop editor. It will auto-adjust to the column width. Each editor block has its owns settings, such as granular control on padding.

For more information on how to use and customize these editor blocks in your email, check out the [More creative details]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/drag_and_drop/overview/#creative-details) section.

{% alert tip %}
You can also [add custom attributes]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/drag_and_drop/overview/#creative-details/) to any URL within the `Image`, `Button`, or `Text` editor blocks.

For `Auto Width`, automatic image resizing picks the best size for the image based on a combination of image width and available space in the layout:
- Images wider than the available space will be set at 100% width and will keep this ratio on mobile, using the entire device display width.
