# About Banners

> With Banners, you can create personalized messaging for your users, all while extending the reach of your other channels, such as email or push notifications. You can embed Banners directly in your app or website, which lets you engage with users through an experience that feels natural.

Banners are available as part of your Message Credits entitlements. If you're not on our flexible Message Credits model, Banners are available as an add-on feature. Reach out to your Braze customer success manager for more information.

## Why use Banners?

Banners allow marketing and product teams to personalize app or website content dynamically, reflecting real-time user eligibility and behavior. They persistently display messages inline, providing non-intrusive, contextually relevant experiences that update automatically at the start of each user session.

Once Banners are integrated into an app or website, marketers can design and launch Banners using a simple drag-and-drop editor, eliminating the need for ongoing developer assistance, reducing complexity, and improving efficiency.

Because they never expire and are personalized every time a user starts a new session, they’re great for:

- Highlighting featured content, trending products, or promotions
- Notifying users about upcoming events or important dates
- Promoting loyalty programs and personalized offers
- Guiding users through onboarding flows and account setup
- Upselling or cross-selling complementary products
- Seasonal or ongoing brand campaigns

### Features

Key features for Banners include:

- **Easy content building:** Drag rows and editor blocks to structure your Banner, including images, text, buttons, email capture forms, and custom HTML.
- **Real-time preview:** Instantly preview your Banners on different device views or using custom dimensions, ensuring a seamless user experience on mobile and desktop.
- **Dynamic personalization:** Utilize Braze’s built-in personalization options and Liquid logic, refreshing dynamically for each user’s session.
