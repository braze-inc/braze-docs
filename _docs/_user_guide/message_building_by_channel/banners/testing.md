# Banner testing

> It’s important to send a test Banner message before launching your campaign so you can ensure all media, copy, personalization, and custom attributes render correctly.

Our preview and testing capabilities offer two ways to look at your Banners:

- You can preview your Banner as you compose it. This can help you visualize what your final message will look like from your user’s perspective. 
- Send a test message to yourself or a specific user’s device.

## Previewing your Banner

In the **Preview** tab of your composer, the view of your message might not be identical to its actual rendering on the user’s device.

![Preview tab of the Banner composer.]({% image_buster /assets/img/banners/preview_banner.png %})

## Sending a test message

When sending a test Banner, be sure to check for the following:

- The campaign must be assigned to a placement.
- The placement must be requested from the user.
- You can view Banners sent using the test send for up to 5 minutes on the assigned placement.

## Test checklist

- Is your banner campaign assigned to a placement?
- Do the images and media show up and act as expected?
- Do your links and buttons direct the user to where they should go?
- Does the Liquid function as expected? Have you accounted for a default attribute value in the event that the Liquid returns no information?
- Is your copy clear, concise, and correct?
