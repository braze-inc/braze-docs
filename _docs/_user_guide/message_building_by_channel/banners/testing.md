# Testing Banners

> Learn how to test your Banner message before launching your campaign so you can ensure all media, copy, personalization, and custom attributes render correctly.

## Testing a Banner

You can test your Banner in either of the following ways:

### Previewing your message

While composing your Banner message, preview it to see how it'll look for your users.

In the **Preview** tab of your composer, the view of your message might not be identical to its actual rendering on the user’s device.

![Preview tab of the Banner composer.]({% image_buster /assets/img/banners/preview_banner.png %})

### Sending a test message

Send a test message to yourself or a specific user’s device.
When sending a test Banner, be sure to check for the following:

- The campaign must be assigned to a placement.
- The placement must be requested from the user.
- You can view Banners sent using the test send for up to 5 minutes on the assigned placement.

## Test checklist

- Is your banner campaign assigned to a placement?
- Do the images and media show up and act as expected?
- Do your links and buttons direct the user to where they should go?
- Does the Liquid function as expected? Have you accounted for a default attribute value in the event that the Liquid returns no information?
- Is your copy clear, concise, and correct?
