# Testing Banners

> Learn how to test your Banner message before launching your campaign so you can ensure all media, copy, personalization, and custom attributes render correctly. For more general information, see [About Banners]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/banners).

## Prerequisites

Before you can test Banner messages in Braze, you'll need to create a [Banner campaign in Braze]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/banners/creating_campaigns/). Additionally, verify that the placement you want to test is already [placed in your app or website]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/banners/creating_placements).
