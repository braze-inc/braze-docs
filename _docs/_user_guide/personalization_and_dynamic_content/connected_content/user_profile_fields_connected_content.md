# Pulling user profile data in Connected Content calls

If a Connected Content response contains user profile fields (within a Liquid personalization tag), these values must be defined earlier in the message via Liquid, before the Connected Content call in order to render the Liquid passback properly. Similarly, the `:rerender` flag must be included in the request. 

{% alert note %}
The `:rerender` flag is only one level deep, meaning that it will not apply to any nested Connected Content tags.
{% endalert %}

For personalization, Braze pulls user profile fields before passing that field to Liquidâ€”so if the response from Connected Content has user profile fields, it must be defined beforehand. 

For example, if this were the Connected Content call:
{% raw %}
```liquid
Hi ${first_name},
{% connected_content https://examplewebsite.com :rerender %}
```
{% endraw %}
And the Connected Content response is {% raw %}`Your language is ${language}`{% endraw %}, the content displayed in this scenario will be `Hi Jon, your language is`. The language itself will not be templated.

In order to render the Liquid passback properly, you must put the {% raw %}`${language}`{%endraw%} tag anywhere in the body, as shown in the following code snippet.
{%raw%}
```liquid
"Hi ${first_name}, {% connected_content https://examplewebsite.com?language=${language} :rerender %}
```
{% endraw %}
{% alert important %}
Remember that the `:rerender` flag option is only one level deep. If the Connected Content response itself has more Connected Content tags, Braze will not re-render those additional tags.
{% endalert %}
