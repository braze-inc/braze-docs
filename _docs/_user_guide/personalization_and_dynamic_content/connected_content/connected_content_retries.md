# Using retry logic for Connected Content

> This page covers how to add retries to your Connected Content calls.

## How retries work 

Because Connected Content relies on receiving data from APIs, an API might be intermittently unavailable while Braze makes the call. In this case, Braze supports retry logic to re-attempt the request using exponential backoff.

{% alert note %}
Connected Content `:retry` is not available for in-app messages.
{% endalert %}

## Using retry logic

To use retry logic, add the `:retry` tag to the Connected Content call, as shown in the following code snippet:

{% raw %}
```
{% connected_content https://yourwebsite.com/api/endpoint :retry %}
{% connected_content https://www.braze.com :save my_content :basic_auth auth_name :retry %}
```
{% endraw %}

When a `:retry` tag is included in the Connected Content call, Braze will attempt to retry the call up to five times.

### Retry outcomes

#### When the API call fails and retries are enabled

If the API call fails and this is enabled, Braze will retry the call while respecting the [rate limit]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/testing_and_more/rate-limiting/#delivery-speed-rate-limiting) you set for each resend. Braze will move any failed messages to the back of the queue and add additional minutes, if necessary, to the total minutes it would take to send your message.

#### When a retry succeeds

If a retried attempt succeeds, the message is sent and no further retries are attempted for that message. If the Connected Content call errors out over five times, the message is aborted, similar to how an [abort message tag]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/connected_content/aborting_connected_content/) is triggered.
