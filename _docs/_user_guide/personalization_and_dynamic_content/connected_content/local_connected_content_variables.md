# Local Connected Content variables

> This page provides an overview of local Connected Content variables and how to use and store them.

Braze makes a standard GET request at send time to the endpoint specified within the `connected_content` tag. If the endpoint returns JSON, it's automatically parsed and stored in a variable called `connected`. If the endpoint returns text, it will be directly inserted into the message in place of the `connected_content` tag.

If you want to save your response to a variable, it's recommended to return JSON objects. And if you want the response of Connected Content to replace the tag with the text, make sure the response isn't valid JSON (as defined by [json.org](http://www.json.org))

You can also specify `:save your_variable_name` after the URL to save the data as something else. For example, the following `connected_content` tag will store the response to a local variable called `localweather` (you can save multiple `connected_content` JSON variables):

{% raw %}
```js
{% connected_content https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/2459115/ :save localweather %}
```
{% endraw %}

Metaweather is a free weather API that uses a "Where-on-Earth ID" to return weather in an area. Use this code for testing and learning purposes only.

>  The stored variable can only be accessed within the field which contains the `connected_content` request. For example, if you wanted to use the `localweather` variable in both the message and title field, you should make the `connected_content` request within both fields. If the request is identical, Braze will use the cached results, rather than making a second request to the destination server. However, Connected Content calls made via HTTP POST do not cache by default and will make a second request to the destination server. If you wish to add caching to POST calls, refer to the [`cache_max_age`](#configurable-caching) option.

## JSON parsing

Connected Content will interpret any JSON-formatted results into a local variable, when you specify `:save`. For example, a weather-related Connected Content endpoint returns the following JSON object, which you store into a local variable `localweather` by specifying `:save localweather`.
{% raw %}

```js
{
  "consolidated_weather": [
    {
      "id": 5.8143475362693e+15,
      "weather_state_name": "Clear",
      "weather_state_abbr": "c",
      "wind_direction_compass": "WSW",
      "created": "2017-06-12T14:14:46.268110Z",
      "applicable_date": "2017-06-12",
      "min_temp": 22.511666666667,
      "max_temp": 31.963333333333,
      "the_temp": 27.803333333333,
      "wind_speed": 6.8884690250312,
      "wind_direction": 251.62921994166,
      "air_pressure": 1021.335,
      "humidity": 50,
      "visibility": 14.945530601288,
      "predictability": 68
    },
    .
    .
    .
    "title": "New York",
    "location_type": "City",
    "woeid": 2459115,
    "latt_long": "40.71455,-74.007118",
    "timezone": "US\/Eastern"
  }
```

You can test whether or not it's raining by referencing `{{localweather.consolidated_weather[0].weather_state_name}}`, which if used on this object would return `Clear`. If you want to also personalize with the resulting location name, `{{localweather.title}}` returns `New York`.
{% endraw %}

The following image illustrates the type of syntax highlighting you should see in the dashboard if you're setting things up correctly. It also demonstrates how you could leverage the example `connected_content` request!

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% connected_content https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/search/?query={{custom_attribute.${customCity}}} :save locationjson %}
{% connected_content https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/{{locationjson[0].woeid}}/ :save localweather %}

{% if {{localweather.consolidated_weather[0].weather_state_name}} == 'Rain' %}
It's raining! Grab an umbrella!
{% elsif {{localweather.consolidated_weather[0].weather_state_name}} == 'Clouds' %}
No sunscreen needed :)
{% else %}
Enjoy the weather!
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

If the API responded with {%raw%}`{{localweather.consolidated_weather[0].weather_state_name}}`{%endraw%} returning `Rain`, the user would then receive this push.

![Push notification with the message "It's raining! Grab an umbrella!"]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/connected_weather_push2.png %} "Connected Content Push Usage Example"){:style="max-width:50%" }

By default, Connected Content will set a `Content-Type` header on a GET HTTP request that it makes to `application/json` with `Accept: */*`. If you require another content type, specify it explicitly by adding `:content_type your/content-type` to the tag. Braze will then set both the Content-Type and Accept header to the type you specify.

{% raw %}
```js
{% connected_content http://numbersapi.com/random/trivia :content_type application/json %}
```
{% endraw %}

## HTTP POST

By default, Connected Content makes an HTTP GET request to the specified URL. To make a POST request instead, specify `:method post`.

You can optionally provide a POST body by specifying `:body` followed by either a query string of the format `key1=value1&key2=value2&...` or a reference to captured values. Content-Type defaults to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. If you specify `:content_type application/json` and provide a form-urlencoded body such as `key1=value1&key2=value2`, Braze will automatically JSON-encode the body before sending.

Connected Content also does not cache POST calls by default. You can update this behavior by adding `:cache_max_age` to the Connected Content POST call.

#### Default content-type

{% raw %}
```js
{% connected_content https://example.com/api/endpoint :method post :body key1=value1&key2=value2 %}
```
#### Application/JSON Content-Type

```js
{% connected_content https://example.com/api/endpoint :method post :body key1=value1&key2=value2 :content_type application/json %}
```
{% endraw %}

### Providing JSON body

If you want to provide your own JSON body, you can write it inline if there are no spaces. If your body has spaces, you should use an assign or capture statement. That is, any of these three are acceptable:

{% raw %}
##### Inline: spaces not allowed

```js
{% connected_content https://example.com/api/endpoint :method post :body {"foo":"bar","baz":"{{1|plus:1}}"} :content_type application/json %}
```

##### Body in a capture statement: spaces allowed

```js
{% capture postbody %}
{"foo": "bar", "baz": "{{ 1 | plus: 1 }}"}
{% endcapture %}
{% connected_content https://example.com/api/endpoint :method post :body {{postbody}} :content_type application/json %}
```
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
```js
{% capture postbody %}
{
"ids":[ca_57832,ca_75869],"include":{"attributes":{"withKey":["daily_deals"]}}
}
{% endcapture %}

{% connected_content
    https://example.com/api/endpoint
    :method post
    :headers {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
  :body {{postbody}}
  :save result
%}
```
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
##### Body in an assign statement: spaces allowed

```js
{% assign postbody = '{"foo":"bar", "baz": "2"}' %}
{% connected_content https://example.com/api/endpoint :method post :body {{postbody}} :content_type application/json %}
```
{% endraw %}

## HTTP status codes

You can utilize the HTTP status from a Connected Content call by first saving it as a local variable and then using the `__http_status_code__` key. For example:

{% raw %}
```js
{% connected_content https://example.com/api/endpoint :save result %}
{% if result.__http_status_code__ != 200 %}
  {% abort_message('Connected Content returned a non-200 status code') %}
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

{% alert important %}
This key will only be automatically added to the Connected Content object if the endpoint returns a valid JSON object and a `2XX` response. If the endpoint returns an array or other type, that key cannot be automatically set in the response.
{% endalert %}
