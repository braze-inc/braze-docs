# Creating a catalog

> Creating a catalog involves importing a CSV file of non-user data into Braze. This allows you to then access that information to enrich your messages. You can bring in any type of data into a catalog. This data is typically some sort of metadata from your company such as product information for an ecommerce business, or course information for an education provider.

Some common use cases for catalogs include:

- Products
- Services
- Food
- Upcoming events
- Music
- Packages

Once this information is imported, you can begin accessing it in messages in a similar way to accessing custom attributes or custom event properties through Liquid.

## Preparing your CSV file

Before creating a catalog, be sure to have your CSV file ready if your preferred catalog creation method is to upload.

{% endalert %}

### CSV file guidelines

Note these guidelines when creating your CSV file. The first column of the CSV file must be a header of `id`, and each item's `id` must be unique. All other column names must be unique. Additionally, the following limitations apply to catalog CSV files:

- Maximum of 1,000 fields (columns)
- Maximum field (column) name of 250 characters
- Maximum 100&nbsp;MB for all CSV files combined across your company (Free)
- Maximum CSV file size of 2&nbsp;GB (Pro)
- Maximum field value (cell) of 5,000 characters
- Only letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores for `id` and header values

We also recommend formatting all text in your CSV files as lowercase. Make sure you're encoding your CSV file using the UTF-8 format to upload your CSV file in the next step successfully.

## Selecting your method

To create a catalog, go to **Data Settings** > **Catalogs**.

{% alert note %}
If you are using the [older navigation]({{site.baseurl}}/navigation), you can find **Catalogs** under **Data**.
{% endalert %}

Click **Create New Catalog**, then choose to either **Upload CSV** or **Create in browser**.

### Method 1: Upload CSV

1. Drag and drop your file to the upload zone, or click **Upload CSV** and choose your file. <br>![][1]{: style="max-width:80%;"} <br><br>
2. Select one of the following data types for each column: boolean, number, string, or time.
<br> ![][9]{: style="max-width:80%;"} <br><br>
3. Give your catalog a name. Keep in mind the following requirements for a catalog name:
- Must be unique
- Maximum of 250 characters
- Can only include numbers, letters, hyphens, and underscores<br><br>
4. (optional) Add a description for the catalog.
5. Click **Process Catalog** to create the catalog.

{% alert note %}
This data type cannot be edited after you set up your catalog.
{% endalert %}

You can also use templates in a catalog name. For example, you can use the following:
{% raw %}
```liquid
{% assign language = "content_spanish" %}

{% catalog_items language fall_campaign %}
{{ items[0].body }}
```
{% endraw %}

{% alert important %}
Your CSV file can be rejected if you go above your [tier](#tiers). 
{% endalert %}

You can also update the CSV file after selecting to create a catalog in the browser. Click **Update Catalog > Upload CSV**, then select whether to update, add, or delete items in your catalog.

### Method 2: Create in the browser

1. Enter a name for your catalog. Keep in mind the following requirements for your catalog name:
- Must be unique
- Maximum of 250 characters
- Can only include numbers, letters, hyphens, and underscores <br> ![][14]{: style="max-width:80%;"} <br><br>
2. (optional) Type a description for your catalog.
3. Select the catalog you've just created from the list **Catalogs** page to update your catalog.
4. Click **Update Catalog > Add fields** to add your fields. Then, enter the **Field name** and use the dropdown to select the data type. Repeat as needed.<br> ![][12]{: style="max-width:50%;"}<br><br>
5. Click **Update Catalog > Add items** to add an item to your catalog by entering the information based on the fields you previously added. Then, click **Save Item** or **Save and Add Another** to continue adding your items. <br> ![][13]{: style="max-width:50%;"}

You can also upload a CSV file after selecting to create a catalog in the browser.

{% alert note %}
Braze processes time values based on the dashboard timestamp. For example, if a column has a value of "03/13/2024" and your time zone is the Pacific Time Zone, this time would be imported to Braze as "Mar 12, 2024, 5:00 PM".
{% endalert %}

#### Tutorial: Creating a catalog from a CSV file

For this tutorial, we're using a catalog that lists two games, their cost, and an image link.

<style type="text/css">
.tg td{word-break:normal;}
.tg th{word-break:normal;font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; background-color: #f4f4f7; text-transform: lowercase; color: #212123; font-family: "Sailec W00 Bold",Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;}
.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;word-break:normal}
</style>
<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0pky">id</th>
    <th class="tg-0pky">title</th>
    <th class="tg-0pky">price</th>
    <th class="tg-0pky">image_link</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">1234</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">Tales</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">7.49</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">https://picsum.photos/200</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">1235</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">Regeneration</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">22.49</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">https://picsum.photos/200</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

We'll create the catalog by uploading a CSV file. The data types for `id`, `title`, `price`, and `image_link` are string, string, number, and string, respectively. 

{% alert note %}
This data type cannot be edited after you set up your catalog.
{% endalert %}

![][9]{: style="max-width:85%;"}

Next, we'll name this catalog "games_catalog" and click the **Process Catalog** button. Then, Braze will check the catalog for any errors before catalog creation.

![][11]{: style="max-width:85%;"}

Note that you won't be able to edit this name after the catalog is created. You can delete a catalog and re-upload an updated version using the same catalog name.

After creating the catalog, you can begin referencing the [catalog in a campaign]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/using_catalogs/).

## Managing catalogs through API

As you build more catalogs, you can also use the [List catalogs endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/catalogs/catalog_management/synchronous/get_list_catalogs/) to return a list of the catalogs in a workspace.

### Managing catalog items

In addition to managing your catalogs, you can also use asynchronous and synchronous endpoints to manage the catalog items. This includes the ability to edit and delete catalog items, and to list catalog item details. 

For example, if you want to edit an individual catalog item, you can use the [`/catalogs/catalog_name/items/item_id` endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/catalogs/catalog_items/synchronous/patch_catalog_item/).

## Additional use cases

### Multiple items

You aren't limited to just one item in a single message! Simply insert the additional catalog items and information to display using the **Add Personalization** modal. Note that you can add up to three catalog items only. 

Check out this example where we add the `id` of three games, Tales, Teslagrad, and Acaratus, for **Catalog Items** and select `title` for **Information to Display**.

![][6]{: style="max-width:70%" }

We can further personalize our message by adding some text around our Liquid:

{% raw %}
```liquid
Get the ultimate trio {% catalog_items games 1234 1235 1236 %}
{{ items[0].title }}, {{ items[1].title }}, and {{ items[2].title }} today!
```
{% endraw %}

This returns as the following:

> Get the ultimate trio Tales, Teslagrad, and Acaratus today!

{% alert tip %}
Check out [selections]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/selections/) to create groups of data for more personalized messaging!
{% endalert %}

### Using Liquid `if` statements

You can use catalog items to create conditional statements. For example, you can trigger a certain message to display when a specific item is selected in your campaign.

To do this, you'll use a Liquid `if` statement in a format like this:

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% catalog_items Test-list 1234 %}
{% if {{items[0].first-item}} == true %}
Do this
{% else %}
Do that
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

You must declare the catalog name before using `if` statements. In the example above, `Test-list` is the catalog name.

#### Use case: Liquid `if` snippet

In this scenario, different messages will display if the custom attribute `venue_name` has more then 10 characters or less then 10 characters. If `venue_name` is `blank`, nothing will display.

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% catalog_selection_items venue-list venue_selection %} 
{% if items[0].venue_name.size > 10 %}
Message if the venue name's size is more than 10 characters. 
{% elsif items[0].venue_name.size < 10 %}
Message if the venue name's size is less than 10 characters. 
{% else %} 
{% abort_message(no venue_name) %} 
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

Note that this scenario uses `catalog_selection_items` instead of `catalog_items`. This is because we're pulling items from a [selection]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/selections/), where `venue-list` is the catalog name and `venue_selection` is the selection. 

### Using images {#using-images}

You can also reference images in the catalog to use in your messaging. To do so, use the `catalogs` tag and `item` object in the Liquid field for images.

For example, to add the `image_link` from our Games catalog to our promotional message for Tales, select the `id` for the **Catalog Items** field and `image_link` for the **Information to Display** field. This adds the following Liquid tags to our image field:

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% catalog_items Games 1234 %}

{{ items[0].image_link }}
```
{% endraw %}

![Content Card composer with catalog Liquid tag used in the image field.][3]

Here's what this looks like when the Liquid is rendered:

![Example Content Card with catalog Liquid tags rendered.][4]{: style="max-width:50%" }

### Templating catalog items

You can also use templating to dynamically pull catalog items based on custom attributes. For example, let's say a user has the custom attribute `wishlist`, which contains an array of game IDs from your catalog.

```json
{
    "attributes": [
        {
            "external_id": "user_id",
            "wishlist": ["1234", "1235"]
        }
    ]
}
```

Using Liquid templating, you can dynamically pull out the wishlist IDs and then use them in your message. To do so, [assign a variable][10] to your custom attribute, then use the **Add Personalization** modal to pull a specific item from the array.

{% alert tip %}
Remember, arrays start at `0`, not `1`.
{% endalert %}

For example, to let a user know that Tales (an item in our catalog that they've wished for) is on sale, we can add the following to our message composer:

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% assign wishlist = {{custom_attribute.${wishlist}}}%}
{% catalog_items Games {{ wishlist[0] }} %}

Get {{ items[0].title }} now, for just {{ items[0].price }}!
```
{% endraw %}

Which will display as the following:
> Get Tales now, for just 7.49!

With templating, you can render a different catalog item for each user based on their individual custom attributes, event properties, or any other templatable field.

### Uploading a CSV

You can upload a CSV of new catalog items to add or catalog items to update. To delete a list of items, you can upload a CSV of item IDs to delete them.

### Using Liquid

You can also manually piece together catalogs Liquid logic. However, note that if you type in an ID that doesn't exist, Braze will still return an items array without objects. We recommend that you include error handling, such as checking the size of the array and using an `if` statement to account for an empty array case.

{% alert note %}
Liquid currently can't be used inside catalogs. If Liquid personalization is listed inside a cell in your catalog, the dynamic value won't render and only the actual Liquid will display.
{% endalert %}

You can leverage our [Catalogs endpoints]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/catalogs/) to manage the growing data and information. This includes the ability to create, edit, and delete catalog items, and to list catalog item details.

For example, you can create a catalog using the [Create catalogs endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/catalogs/catalog_management/synchronous/post_create_catalog/). As you build more catalogs, you can also use the [List catalogs endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/catalogs/catalog_management/synchronous/get_list_catalogs/) to return a list of the catalogs in a workspace.

In addition to managing your catalogs, you can also use asynchronous and synchronous endpoints to manage the catalog items. This includes the ability to edit and delete catalog items, and to list catalog item details. For example, if you want to edit an individual catalog item, you can use the [`/catalogs/catalog_name/items/item_id` endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/catalogs/catalog_items/synchronous/patch_catalog_item/).

#### Templating catalog items including Liquid

Similar to [Connected Content]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/connected_content), you must use the `:rerender` flag in a Liquid tag to render a catalog item's Liquid content. Note that the `:rerender` flag is only one level deep, meaning it won't apply to any nested Liquid tag calls.

{% alert important %}
Templating catalog items that include Liquid is in early access. Reach out to your Braze account manager if you're interested in participating in the early access.
{% endalert %}

If a catalog item contains user profile fields (within a Liquid personalization tag), these values must be defined in Liquid earlier in the message and before the templating in order to render the Liquid properly. If the `:rerender` flag isn't provided, it will render the raw Liquid content.

For example, if a catalog named "Messages" has an item with this Liquid:

![]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/catalog_liquid_templating.png %}){: style="max-width:80%;"}

To render the following Liquid content:

{% raw %}
```liquid
Hi ${first_name}

{% catalog_items Messages greet_msg :rerender %}
{{ items[0].Welcome_Message }}
```
{% endraw %}

This will display as the following:

{% raw %}
```
Hi Peter,

Welcome to our store, Peter!
```
{% endraw %}

{% alert note %}
Catalog Liquid tags can't be used recursively inside catalogs.
{% endalert %}

## Catalog tiers {#tiers}

The following table describes the differences between the free and pro version of catalogs:

{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3}

### Catalog storage

{% alert important %}
The package entitlement shown in the Braze dashboard is rounded to the nearest unit for visual purposes; however, you are still entitled to the full entitlement purchased. To request an upgrade for catalog storage, contact your Braze account manager.
{% endalert %}

#### Free version

The storage size for the free version of catalogs is up to 100&nbsp;MB. You can have unlimited items as long as it's under 100&nbsp;MB. Selections will contribute to your storage. The more complex a selection is, the more storage it will take up.

#### Catalogs Pro

At a company level, the maximum storage for Catalogs Pro is based on the size of catalog data. The storage size options are: 5&nbsp;GB, 10&nbsp;GB, or 15&nbsp;GB. Note that the free version's storage (100&nbsp;MB) is included in each of these plans.
