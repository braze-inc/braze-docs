# Braze Data Platform overview

> Braze Data Platform is a set of comprehensive, composable set of data capabilities and partner integrations that empowers you to create personalized, impactful experiences across the customer lifecycle based on three data related jobs to be done: Data Unification, Data Activation, and Data Distribution.

By using a combination of features in the Braze Data Platform, you can leverage your data to create meaningful, targeted messages that respond to what your customers do in real-time.

## Unify your data 

Collect and consolidate first-party data from any source, using [APIs] and [SDKs]. You can also leverage our built-in ingestion tools like [Cloud Data Ingestion]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/unification/cloud_ingestion) to create a simple integration directly from your data warehouse or file storage solution to Braze, or use [Data Transformation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/unification/data_transformation) to build and manage webhook integrations to collect your data to transfer into Braze.

## Activate your data

Clean, organize, and prepare your data for use. This involves understanding your customers' behaviors and preferences in real-time with user profiles and segments. Reference the [Reports metric glossary]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/activation/report_metrics) as you create targeted messages to identify how your customers are responding to these personalized experiences.

## Distribute your data

Stream and export your data to external systems for next-step insights and decisions. Use [Braze Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/distribution/braze_currents) to stream Braze event data into a data warehouse to power business intelligence tools.
