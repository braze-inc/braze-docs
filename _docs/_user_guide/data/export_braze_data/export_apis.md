# Export APIs

> This page covers Braze Export APIs, which allow you to programmatically export a JSON file of dashboard data. Refer to [Export endpoints][24] for a list of data that you can access, including instructions and sample code for the export.

## When to use export APIs instead of CVS downloads

There are a few reasons why you would prefer this method over exporting a CSV directly from the dashboard:

 - Your file is very large. From our dashboard, you can export a CSV with at most 500,000 rows. If you're exporting data on a segment with over 500,000 users, you'll need to use our export API, which has no limit on how much you can export.
 -  You want to interact with the data programmatically.
