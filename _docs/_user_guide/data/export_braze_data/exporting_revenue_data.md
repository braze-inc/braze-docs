# Export revenue and total revenue data

> This page covers the [Revenue Report]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/reporting/revenue_report/) page of the dashboard, where you can view data on revenue over specific periods of time, a specific product revenue, and your app's total revenue.

You can find the **Revenue Report** under **Analytics**.

{% alert note %}
If you're using the [older navigation]({{site.baseurl}}/navigation), you can find **Revenue** under **Data**.
{% endalert %}

{% alert tip %}
Looking for more ways to get revenue data? Try adding purchase behavior (as well as purchase of a product) to campaigns or Canvases as [conversion events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/building_campaigns/conversion_events/).
{% endalert %}

To export your revenue data, select <i class="fas fa-bars" title="Chart context menu"></i> in the **Performance Over Time** graph and select your export option.

## Total revenue

You can view revenue statistics on a case-by-case basis on the [Campaign Analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/reporting/campaign_analytics/) or [Canvas Analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/testing_canvases/measuring_and_testing_with_canvas_analytics/) pages. 

{% multi_lang_include metrics.md metric='Total Revenue' %}

{% alert tip %}
Revenue reports cannot be exported through API. For help with CSV exports, refer to [export troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/export_braze_data/export_troubleshooting/).
{% endalert %}

## Direct revenue

You can view the following additional revenue metrics by generating a Campaign Comparison Report using the [Report Builder][1]:

- [Total Direct Revenue][2]
- [Total Direct Purchases][3]
- [Unique Direct Purchases][4]
- [Revenue per Recipient][5]

These metrics are based on last-click attribution, which means that revenue will be attributed to a campaign if that campaign:

1. Is the last campaign the user clicked prior to purchasing
    <br>**AND**<br>
2. Was clicked by the user less than 3 days prior to purchasing
