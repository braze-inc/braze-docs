# Export Canvas data

> User data can be exported to a CSV. This page covers how to export data for your entire Canvas or a specific Canvas component.

## Exporting data for a Canvas

To export data for a Canvas, do the following:

1. Go to **Messaging** > **Canvas** and select your Canvas.
2. Select the **User Data** dropdown in the **Canvas Details** section. 
3. Select one of the following export options:
  - **CSV Export User Data** or
  - **CSV Export Email Address**.

You can also export user data for all the entrants of a Canvas as a CSV file.

## Exporting data for a component (original workflow only)

Canvas results can be exported on an individual component basis for the original Canvas workflow. To do this, select the specific component, then select the **User Data** dropdown in the **Canvas Step Details** page.
