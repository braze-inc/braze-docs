# Syncing account data using CDI

> Learn how to sync your Braze account data using CDI.

{% alert important %}
[Account objects](https://braze.com/unlisted_docs/account_opportunity_object/) are currently in beta, which is required to use this feature. Contact your Braze account manager if you’re interested in participating in the beta.
{% endalert %}

## Prerequisites

Before you can sync your account data using CDI, you'll need to [configure your accounts schema](https://braze.com/unlisted_docs/account_opportunity_object/).

{% alert note %}
Only make updates to your account schema when the sync is paused or not scheduled to avoid conflicts between your data warehouse data and the schema in Braze.
{% endalert %}

## How syncing works

- Each sync imports rows where `UPDATED_AT` is later than the last synced timestamp.
- Data from the integration creates or updates accounts based on the provided `id`.
- If `DELETED` is `true`, the account is deleted.
- Syncing doesn’t log data points, but all synced data counts toward your total accounts usage, measured by total stored data—there’s no need to limit to only changed data.
- Fields not in your accounts schema are dropped; update the schema before syncing new fields.

## Syncing your account data

You can sync your account data using CDI through a data warehouse or a file storage.

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Data Warehouse %}
To integrate your data source with your data warehouse:

{% subtabs %}
{% subtab Snowflake %}

1. Create a source table in Snowflake. Use the names in the example or choose your own database, schema, and table names. You can also use a view or materialized view instead of a table.
  ```json
    CREATE DATABASE BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION;
    CREATE SCHEMA BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION.INGESTION;
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION.INGESTION.ACCOUNTS_SYNC (
         UPDATED_AT TIMESTAMP_NTZ(9) NOT NULL DEFAULT SYSDATE(),
         --ID of the account to be created or updated
         ID VARCHAR(16777216) NOT NULL,
         --Name of the account to be created or updated
         NAME VARCHAR(16777216) NOT NULL,
         --Account fields and values that should be added or updated
         PAYLOAD VARCHAR(16777216) NOT NULL,
         --The account associated with this ID should be deleted
         DELETED BOOLEAN
    );
    ```
2. Create a role, warehouse, and user, and grant permissions. If you already have credentials from another sync, you can reuse them—just make sure they have access to the accounts table.
    ```json
    CREATE ROLE BRAZE_INGESTION_ROLE;

    GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION TO ROLE BRAZE_INGESTION_ROLE;
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION.INGESTION TO ROLE BRAZE_INGESTION_ROLE;
    GRANT SELECT ON TABLE BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION.INGESTION.ACCOUNTS_SYNC TO ROLE BRAZE_INGESTION_ROLE;

    CREATE WAREHOUSE BRAZE_INGESTION_WAREHOUSE;
    GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE BRAZE_INGESTION_WAREHOUSE TO ROLE BRAZE_INGESTION_ROLE;

    CREATE USER BRAZE_INGESTION_USER;
    GRANT ROLE BRAZE_INGESTION_ROLE TO USER BRAZE_INGESTION_USER;
    ```
3. If you use network policies, allowlist the Braze IPs so the CDI service can connect. For the list of IPs, see [Cloud Data Ingestion]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/cloud_ingestion/integrations/#step-1-set-up-tables-or-views).
4. In the Braze dashboard, go to **Data Settings** > **Cloud Data Ingestion** and create a new sync.
5. Enter connection details (or reuse existing ones), then add the source table.
6. Select the **Accounts** sync type, then enter the integration name and schedule. 
7. Choose the sync frequency.
8. Add the public key from the dashboard to the user you created. This requires a user with `SECURITYADMIN` access or higher in Snowflake. 
9. Select **Test Connection** to confirm the setup. 
10. When you're finished, save the sync.

{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab Redshift %}

1. Create a source table in Redshift. Use the names in the example or choose your own database, schema, and table names. You can also use a view or materialized view instead of a table.
    ```json
    CREATE DATABASE BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION;
    CREATE SCHEMA BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION.INGESTION;
    CREATE TABLE BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION.INGESTION.ACCOUNTS_SYNC (
       updated_at timestamptz default sysdate not null,
       --ID of the account to be created or updated
       id varchar not null,
       --Name of the account to be created or updated
       name varchar not null,
       --Account fields and values that should be added or updated
       payload varchar(max),
       --The account associated with this ID should be deleted
       deleted boolean
    )
    ```
2. Create a user and grant permissions. If you already have credentials from another sync, you can reuse them—just make sure they have access to the accounts table.
    {% raw %}
    ```json 
    CREATE USER braze_user PASSWORD '{password}';
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION.INGESTION to braze_user;
    GRANT SELECT ON TABLE ACCOUNTS_SYNC TO braze_user;
    ```
    {% endraw %}
3. If you have a firewall or network policies, allow Braze access to your Redshift instance. For the list of IPs, see [Cloud Data Ingestion]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/cloud_ingestion/integrations/#step-1-set-up-tables-or-views).

{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab BigQuery %}

1. (Optional) Create a new project or dataset for your source table.  
    ```json
    CREATE SCHEMA BRAZE-CLOUD-PRODUCTION.INGESTION;
    ```

2. Create the source table for your CDI integration:  
    ```json
    CREATE TABLE `BRAZE-CLOUD-PRODUCTION.INGESTION.ACCOUNTS_SYNC`
    (
      updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT current_timestamp,
      id STRING,
      name STRING,
      payload JSON,
      deleted BOOLEAN
    );
    ```

    Refer to the following when creating your source table:

    | Field Name | Type | Required? |
    | ---------- | ---- | --------- |
    | `UPDATED_AT` | Timestamp | Yes |
    | `PAYLOAD` | JSON | Yes |
    | `ID` | String | Yes |
    | `NAME` | String | Yes |
    | `DELETED` | Boolean | Optional |
    {: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3 role="presentation"}

{:start="3"}
3. Create a user and grant permissions. If you already have credentials from another sync, you can reuse them as long as they have access to the accounts table.

    | Permission | Purpose |
    |------------|---------|
    | BigQuery Connection User | Allows Braze to connect. |
    | BigQuery User | Allows Braze to run queries, read metadata, and list tables. |
    | BigQuery Data Viewer | Allows Braze to view datasets and contents. |
    | BigQuery Job User | Allows Braze to run jobs. |
    {: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation"}

    After granting permissions, generate a JSON key. See [Keys create and delete](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete) for instructions. You’ll upload it in the Braze dashboard later.

{:start="4"}
4. If you use network policies, allow Braze IPs to access your BigQuery instance. For the list of IPs, see [Cloud Data Ingestion]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/cloud_ingestion/integrations/#step-1-set-up-tables-or-views).

{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab Databricks %}

1. Create a catalog or schema for your source table.  
    ```json
    CREATE SCHEMA BRAZE-CLOUD-PRODUCTION.INGESTION;
    ```

2. Create the source table for your CDI integration:  
    ```json
    CREATE TABLE `BRAZE-CLOUD-PRODUCTION.INGESTION.ACCOUNTS_SYNC`
    (
      updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT current_timestamp(),
      id STRING,
      name STRING,
      payload STRING, STRUCT, or MAP,
      deleted BOOLEAN
    );
    ```

    Refer to the following when creating your source table:

    | Field Name | Type | Required? |
    | ---------- | ---- | --------- |
    | `UPDATED_AT` | Timestamp | Yes |
    | `PAYLOAD` | String, Struct, or Map | Yes |
    | `ID` | String | Yes |
    | `NAME` | String | Yes |
    | `DELETED` | Boolean | Optional |
    {: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3 role="presentation"}

{:start="3"}
3. Create a personal access token in Databricks:
    1. Select your username, then select **User Settings**.  
    2. On the **Access tokens** tab, select **Generate new token**.  
    3. Add a comment to identify the token, such as "Braze CDI".  
    4. Leave **Lifetime (days)** blank for no expiration, then select **Generate**.  
    5. Copy and save the token securely for use in the Braze dashboard.

{:start="4"}
4. If you use network policies, allow Braze IPs to access your Databricks instance. For the list of IPs, see [Cloud Data Ingestion]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/cloud_ingestion/integrations/#step-1-set-up-tables-or-views).

{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab Microsoft Fabric %}

1. Create one or more tables for your CDI integration with these fields:
    ```json
    CREATE OR ALTER TABLE [warehouse].[schema].[CDI_table_name] 
    (
      UPDATED_AT DATETIME2(6) NOT NULL,
      PAYLOAD VARCHAR NOT NULL,
      ID VARCHAR NOT NULL,
      NAME VARCHAR NOT NULL,
      DELETED BIT
    )
    GO
    ```

{:start="2"}
2. Create a service principal and grant permissions. If you already have credentials from another sync, you can reuse them—just make sure they have access to the accounts table.

{:start="3"}
3. If you use network policies, allow Braze IPs to access your Microsoft Fabric instance. For the list of IPs, see [Cloud Data Ingestion]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/cloud_ingestion/integrations/#step-1-set-up-tables-or-views).

{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab File Storage %}
To sync account data from file storage, create a source file with the following fields.

| Field | Required? | Description |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| `ID` | Yes | ID of the Account to update or create |  
| `NAME` | Yes | Name of the Account |  
| `PAYLOAD` | Yes | JSON string of the fields to sync to the account in Braze |  
| `DELETED` | Optional | Boolean indicating to delete the account from Braze |  
| `UPDATED_AT` | _*Unsupported_ | File storage doesn't support `UPDATED_AT` columns |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3 role="presentation"}

{% alert note %}
Filenames must follow AWS rules and be unique. Append timestamps to help ensure uniqueness. For more on Amazon S3 syncing, see [File Storage Integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/cloud_ingestion/file_storage_integrations).
{% endalert %}

The following examples show valid JSON and CSV formats for syncing account data from file storage.

{% subtabs %}
{% subtab JSON Accounts %}
```json  
{"id":"s3-qa-0","name":"account0","payload":"{\"attribute_0\": \"GT896\", \"attribute_1\": 74, \"attribute_2\": true, \"retention\": {\"previous_purchases\": 21, \"vip\": false}, \"last_visit\": \"2023-08-08T16:03:26.600803\"}"}
{"id":"s3-qa-1","name":"account1","payload":"{\"attribute_0\": \"GT896\", \"attribute_1\": 74, \"attribute_2\": true, \"retention\": {\"previous_purchases\": 21, \"vip\": false}, \"last_visit\": \"2023-08-08T16:03:26.600803\"}","deleted":true}
{"id":"s3-qa-2","name":"account2","payload":"{\"attribute_0\": \"GT896\", \"attribute_1\": 74, \"attribute_2\": true, \"retention\": {\"previous_purchases\": 21, \"vip\": false}, \"last_visit\": \"2023-08-08T16:03:26.600803\"}","deleted":false}
{"id":"s3-qa-3","name":"account3","payload":"{\"attribute_0\": \"GT896\", \"attribute_1\": 74, \"attribute_2\": true, \"retention\": {\"previous_purchases\": 21, \"vip\": false}, \"last_visit\": \"2023-08-08T16:03:26.600803\"}"}
```  

{% alert important %}
Each line in your source file must contain valid JSON or the file will be skipped. 
{% endalert %}
{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab CSV Accounts with Delete %}
```plaintext  
ID,NAME,PAYLOAD,DELETED
85,"ACCOUNT_1","{""region"": ""APAC"", ""employees"": 850}",TRUE 
1,"ACCOUNT_2","{""region"": ""EMEA"", ""employees"": 10000}",FALSE
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab CSV Accounts without Delete %}
```plaintext  
ID,NAME,PAYLOAD
85,"ACCOUNT_1","{""region"": ""APAC"", ""employees"": 850}"
1,"ACCOUNT_2","{""region"": ""EMEA"", ""employees"": 10000}"
```
{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Creating a sync view

Creating a sync view in your data warehouse lets the source refresh automatically without needing to rewrite additional queries.

For example, if you have a table of account data called `account_details_1` with `account_id`, `account_name`, and three additional attributes, you could create a sync view like the following:

{% tabs %}
{% tab Snowflake %}
```json
CREATE VIEW BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION.INGESTION.ACCOUNTS_SYNC AS 
SELECT
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as UPDATED_AT,
    account_id as id,
    account_name as name,
    TO_JSON(
        OBJECT_CONSTRUCT (
            'attribute_1',
            attribute_1,
            'attribute_2',
            attribute_2,
            'attribute_3',
            attribute_3)
    )as PAYLOAD FROM "account_details_1";
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Redshift %}
```json
CREATE TABLE BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION.INGESTION.ACCOUNTS_SYNC AS
SELECT
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as UPDATED_AT,
    account_id as id,
    account_name as name,
    JSON_SERIALIZE(
        OBJECT (
            'attribute_1',
            attribute_1,
            'attribute_2',
            attribute_2,
            'attribute_3',
            attribute_3)
    ) as PAYLOAD FROM "account_details_1";
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab BigQuery %}
```json
CREATE view IF NOT EXISTS BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION.INGESTION.ACCOUNTS_SYNC AS (SELECT
    last_updated as UPDATED_AT,
    account_id as ID,
    account_name as NAME,
    TO_JSON(
      STRUCT(
      attribute_1,
      attribute_2,
      attribute_3,
      )
    ) as PAYLOAD 
  FROM `BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION.INGESTION.account_details_1`);
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Databricks %}
```json
CREATE view IF NOT EXISTS BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION.INGESTION.ACCOUNTS_SYNC AS (SELECT
    last_updated as UPDATED_AT,
    account_id as ID,
    account_name as NAME,
    TO_JSON(
      STRUCT(
      attribute_1,
      attribute_2,
      attribute_3,
      )
    ) as PAYLOAD 
  FROM `BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION.INGESTION.account_details_1`);
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Microsoft Fabric %}
```json
CREATE VIEW [BRAZE_CLOUD_PRODUCTION].[INGESTION].[ACCOUNTS_SYNC]
AS SELECT 
    account_id as ID,
    account_name as NAME,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as UPDATED_AT,
    JSON_OBJECT('attribute_1':attribute_1, 'attribute_2':attribute_2, 'attribute_3':attribute_3, 'attribute_4':attribute_4) as PAYLOAD

FROM [braze].[account_details_1] ;
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
