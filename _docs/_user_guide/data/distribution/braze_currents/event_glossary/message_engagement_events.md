Storage schemas apply to the flat file event data we send to Data Warehouse Storage partners (Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage). For schemas that apply to the other partners, refer to our list of [available partners]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/available_partners/) and check their respective pages.

Contact your account manager or open a [support ticket]({{site.baseurl}}/braze_support/) if you need access to additional event entitlements. If you can't find what you need in this article, check out our [Customer Behavior Events Library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/event_glossary/customer_behavior_events/) or our [Currents sample data examples](https://github.com/Appboy/currents-examples/tree/master/sample-data).

{% details Explanation of message engagement event structure and platform values %}

### Event structure

This event breakdown shows what type of information is generally included in a message engagement event. With a solid understanding of its components, your developers and business intelligence strategy team can use the incoming Currents event data to make data-driven reports and charts, and take advantage of other valuable data metrics.

![Breakdown of a message engagement event showing an email unsubscribe event with the listed properties grouped by user-specific properties, campaign or Canvas tracking properties, and event-specific properties]({% image_buster /assets/img/message_engagement_event.png %})

Message engagement events are comprised of **user-specific** properties, **campaign/canvas tracking** properties, and **event-specific** properties.

### User ID schema

Note the naming conventions for user IDs.

| Braze schema | Currents schema | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `braze_id` | `"USER_ID"` | The unique identifier that is automatically assigned by Braze. |
| `external_id` | `"EXTERNAL_USER_ID"` | The unique identifier of a user's profile that is set by the customer. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation"}

### Platform values

Certain events return a `platform` value that specifies the platform of the user's device.
<br>The following table details the possible returned values:

| User device | Platform value |
| --- | --- |
| iOS | `ios` |
| Android | `android` |
| FireTV | `kindle` |
| Kindle | `kindle` |
| Web | `web` |
| tvOS | `tvos` |
| Roku | `roku` |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation"}

{% enddetails %}

{% alert important %}
Currents will drop events with excessively large payloads of greater than 900&nbsp;KB.
{% endalert %}

{% alert note %}
Objects related to Canvas Flow have IDs that can be used for grouping and translated to human-readable names through the [Export Canvas details endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/export/canvas/get_canvas_details/).
{% endalert %}

{% alert note %}
Certain fields might take longer to display their most recent state after a campaign or Canvas is updated. These fields are:
<ul>
  <li>"campaign_name"</li>
  <li>"canvas_name"</li>
  <li>"canvas_step_name"</li>
  <li>"conversion_behavior"</li>
  <li>"canvas_variation_name"</li>
  <li>"experiment_split_name"</li>
  <li>"message_variation_name"</li>
</ul>
If complete consistency is required, we recommend waiting an hour from the last update to these fields before sending out your messaging to your users.

## Uninstall events {#uninstall-events}

{% apitags %}
Uninstall
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when a user uninstalls an app. Use this data to track when users uninstall an app. While this is currently a message engagement event, this will be changed to a user behavior event in the future.

{% alert important %}
This event is not fired when the user actually uninstalls the app, as that's impossible to track exactly. Braze sends a daily silent push to determine if the app still exists on your user's device, and if we get an error on that silent push, it is assumed the app has been uninstalled.

#### Property details

- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).
- `state_change_source` will return a string of the full source name. For example, the source CSV import will return the string `CSV Import`. Available sources are listed below:

| Source | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SDK | SDK endpoints |
| Dashboard | When a user's subscription state is updated from the User Profile page in Dashboard |
| Subscription Page | When a user unsubscribes through an email link that is not the preference center |
| REST API | REST API endpoints |
| CSV import | CSV user import |
| Preference Center | When a user is updated from the preference center |
| Inbound Message | When a user is updated by inbound messages from end-users through channels such as SMS |
| Migration | When a user is updated by internal migrations or maintenance scripts |
| User Merge | When a user is updated by the user merge process |
| Canvas User Update Step | When a user is updated by the Canvas user update step |

Campaign, Conversion
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when a user does an action that has been set as a conversion event in a campaign.

{% alert note %}
`dispatch_id` is deprecated and will be removed in the next Currents release.
{% endalert %}

{% alert important %}
Note that the conversion event is encoded in the `conversion_behavior` field, which includes the type of conversion event, the window (timeframe), and additional information depending on the conversion event type. The `conversion_behavior_index` field represents which conversion event, such as 0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C, 3 = D.

#### Property details

- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).

#### Property details

- For `ad_id`, `ad_id_type`, and `ad_tracking_enabled`, you need to explicitly collect the iOS IDFA and Android Google advertising ID through the native SDKs. Learn more about this setup for [iOS]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/analytics/managing_data_collection/?sdktab=swift) and [Android]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/sdk_integration/?sdktab=android#android_google-advertising-id).
- If you're using Kafka to ingest [Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/) data, contact your customer success manager to enable sending `ad_id`.

#### Property details

- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).
  - The behavior for `dispatch_id` differs between Canvas and campaigns because Braze treats Canvas steps (except for entry steps, which can be scheduled) as triggered events, even when they are scheduled. Learn more about [dispatch ID behavior]({{site.baseurl}}/help/help_articles/data/dispatch_id/).

#### Property details

- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).
  - The behavior for `dispatch_id` differs between Canvas and campaigns because Braze treats Canvas steps (except for entry steps, which can be scheduled) as triggered events, even when they are scheduled. Learn more about [dispatch ID behavior]({{site.baseurl}}/help/help_articles/data/dispatch_id/).

## Email Deferral events {#email-deferral-events}

{% apitags %}
Email, Deferral
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when an Internet Service Provider does not immediately deliver the email to a non-hard bounced email address and Braze retries the email for up to 72 hours. Typical reasons for deferrals include reputation-based email volume rate-limiting from the inbox provider, temporary connectivity issues, recipient's mailbox is full, or DNS errors.

#### Property details

- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).
  - The behavior for `dispatch_id` differs between Canvas and campaigns because Braze treats Canvas steps (except for entry steps, which can be scheduled) as triggered events, even when they are scheduled.

#### Property details

- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).
  - The behavior for `dispatch_id` differs between Canvas and campaigns because Braze treats Canvas steps (except for entry steps, which can be scheduled) as triggered events, even when they are scheduled.

## Email Send events {#email-send-events}

{% apitags %}
Email, Sends
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when an email send request was successfully communicated between Braze and SendGrid. Though, this does not mean the email was received in the user's inbox.

#### Property details

- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).
  - The behavior for `dispatch_id` differs between Canvas and campaigns because Braze treats Canvas steps (except for entry steps, which can be scheduled) as triggered events, even when they are scheduled. Learn more about [dispatch ID behavior]({{site.baseurl}}/help/help_articles/data/dispatch_id/).
- `message_extras` allow you to annotate your send events with dynamic data from Connected Content, custom attributes (such as language, country), and Canvas entry properties. Refer to [Message extras]({{site.baseurl}}/message_extras_tag/) to learn more.

## Email Unsubscribe events {#email-unsubscribe-events}

{% apitags %}
Email, Subscription
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when the end-user has clicked "unsubscribe" from the email.

{% alert important %}
The `Unsubscribe` event is actually a specialized click event that is fired when your user clicks on the unsubscribe link in the email (either a normal unsubscribe link within the email body or footer, or using the [list-unsubscribe header]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_app_group/email_settings#include-a-list-unsubscribe-header)), not when the user changes state to unsubscribed. If subscription state change is sent through the API, or via custom (non-Braze) unsubscription link, it will not trigger an event on Currents.

#### Property details

- For `ad_id`, `ad_id_type`, and `ad_tracking_enabled`, you need to explicitly collect the iOS IDFA and Android Google advertising ID through the native SDKs. Learn more about this setup for [iOS]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/analytics/managing_data_collection/?sdktab=swift) and [Android]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/sdk_integration/?sdktab=android#android_google-advertising-id).
- If you're using Kafka to ingest [Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/) data, contact your customer success manager to enable sending `ad_id`.

#### Property details

- For `ad_id`, `ad_id_type`, and `ad_tracking_enabled`, you need to explicitly collect the iOS IDFA and Android Google advertising ID through the native SDKs. Learn more about this setup for [iOS]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/analytics/managing_data_collection/?sdktab=swift) and [Android]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/sdk_integration/?sdktab=android#android_google-advertising-id).
- If you're using Kafka to ingest [Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/) data, contact your customer success manager to enable sending `ad_id`.

#### Property details

- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).

#### Property details

- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).

{% endapi %}

{% api %}
## Push Notification Bounce events {#push-notification-bounce-events}

{% apitags %}
Push, Sends, Bounce
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when an error is received from either Apple Push Notification Service or Fire Cloud Messaging. This means that the push message was bounced, and therefore not delivered to the user's device.

#### Property details

- If you're using Kafka to ingest [Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/) data, contact your customer success manager or account manager to enable the feature flipper for sending `ad_id`.
- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).

#### Property details

- For `ad_id`, `ad_id_type`, and `ad_tracking_enabled`, you need to explicitly collect the iOS IDFA and Android Google advertising ID through the native SDKs. Learn more about this setup for [iOS]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/analytics/managing_data_collection/?sdktab=swift) and [Android]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/sdk_integration/?sdktab=android#android_google-advertising-id).
- If you're using Kafka to ingest [Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/) data, contact your customer success manager to enable sending `ad_id`.
- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).

{% api %}
## Push Notification Open events {#push-notification-open-events}

{% apitags %}
Push, Opens
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when a user directly clicks on the Push notification to open the application. Currently, Push Open Events refer specifically to "Direct Opens" rather than "Total Opens". This does not include statistics shown at the campaign level of "influenced opens" as these are not attributed at the user level.

{% alert note %}
In rare cases, a push open may appear before the corresponding push send event in Currents data because of the following:
- Your SDK has an incorrect clock.
- High batch write latency. The recorded send time can lag behind early deliveries, so very quick opens may be logged before the batch's final send timestamp is written. Large sends are dispatched and recorded in batches.

#### Property details

- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).

#### Property details

- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).

#### Property details

- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).

## SMS Inbound Received events {#sms-inbound-received-events}

{% apitags %}
SMS, Inbound Received
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when one of your users sends an SMS to a phone number in one of your Braze SMS subscription groups.

When Braze receives an inbound SMS, we attribute that inbound message to any user that shares that phone number. As a result, you may receive multiple events per inbound message if multiple users in your Braze instance share the same phone number. If you require attribution of specific user IDs based on previous messages sent to that user, you can use the SMS Delivered event to attribute Inbound Received events to the user ID who most recently received a message from your Braze number.

If we detect that this inbound message is a reply to an outbound campaign or Canvas component sent from Braze, we will also include the campaign or Canvas metadata with the event. Braze defines a reply as an inbound message coming within four hours of an outbound message. However, there is a one-minute cache for the attributed campaign information of the last outbound SMS received.

#### Property details

- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).

#### Property details

- `message_extras` allow you to annotate your send events with dynamic data from Connected Content, custom attributes (such as language, country), and Canvas entry properties. Refer to [Message extras]({{site.baseurl}}/message_extras_tag/) to learn more.
- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).

#### Property details

- `message_extras` allow you to annotate your send events with dynamic data from Connected Content, custom attributes (such as language or country), and Canvas entry properties. Refer to [Message extras]({{site.baseurl}}/message_extras_tag/) to learn more.
- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).

#### Property details

- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).

{% endapi %}

{% api %}
## WhatsApp Failure events {#whatsapp-failure-events}

{% apitags %}
WhatsApp, Failure
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when WhatsApp cannot deliver the message to the user. A hard bounce signifies a permanent deliverability failure.

#### Property details

- `dispatch_id` is an ID for a specific message dispatch, such as a campaign send. All push events that originate from the same dispatch include the same `dispatch_id`. Use `dispatch_id` to group events that belong to the same dispatch, allowing you to group and correlate the push message lifecycle for that dispatch (such as Send, Bounce, and Open).
