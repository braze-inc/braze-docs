# November 2017

## Braze notification preferences

You can use the Braze [Notification Preferences Center]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/onboarding/platform_administrative_features/#notification-preferences) within your Company Settings page to opt your team's users into receiving different alerts from Braze via email, such as weekly analytics reports, notifications of when campaigns have sent, and push credential errors. You can also set up a webhook to display the notification in a different channel, [such as Slack]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/onboarding/platform_administrative_features/#slack-incoming-webhook-integration).

## Updates to media library

You can now upload multiple assets and folders of assets to the [media library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/media_library/#media-library) from the **Templates & Media** page, as well as perform bulk actions, such as applying tags or deleting multiple assets.

## Branching for Canvas first steps

You can now create branches on the first step of a variant. This feature will allow you to send multiple messages as the first step of a variant, opening up opportunities to further target your audience.
