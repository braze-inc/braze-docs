# January 2017

## New conversion events for email messages

You can now specify a conversion event for "opened email from campaign" or "clicked email from campaign." Learn more about [campaign delivery types]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/scheduling_and_organizing/delivery_types/).

## CSV export with control group
When exporting a user campaign CSV, you can now include control groups in the data. Learn more about [exporting dashboard data]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/export_braze_data/).

## Welcome and Double Opt-In Emails
You can now use a newly created "Added Email Address" action-based trigger—making it easy to send double opt-in or welcome emails when a user first adds their email address. Learn more about [Email best practices]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/faq/).

## List-Unsubscribe Email Header
You can now configure List-Unsubscribe headers that have a subscription status of "subscribed/opted in users" or "opted in users only." This adds an "unsubscribe" link in Gmail next to the sender's name, which can improve deliverability ratings.

## Usability updates
You can now click a button to minimize the Canvas header for smaller screens and hover over full names of your Canvases and campaigns on your user profile in Braze.
