# April 4, 2023 release

## Documentation breadcrumbs 
You might notice that the Braze Docs site now has breadcrumbs on the top of each article to show you where you are in the site. These are just another option to help you navigate!

![A series of breadcrumbs navigating from User Guide > Message Building by Channel > In-App Messages > Templates > Simple Survey]({% image_buster /assets/img/doc-breadcrumbs.png %}){: style="max-width:55%"}

## Creating catalogs in browser
You can use catalogs to reference non-user data in your Braze campaigns through Liquid. Braze now allows you to create a catalog directly in your browser instead of importing a CSV. Refer to [Creating a catalog]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/catalog) for more for more information.

## Custom SQL in query builder
With the query builder, you can generate reports using Braze data in Snowflake. Now, you can [use custom SQL]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/query_builder/#custom-sql) to unlock new insights.

{% alert important %}
The SQL editor is in early access. If you're interested in participating in the early access, contact your customer success manager.
{% endalert %}

## Feature flag FAQ
We've answered some [frequently asked questions for feature flags]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/feature_flags/faq/).

## Message extras Liquid tag for Currents
Using the [`message_extras` Liquid tag]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/advanced_filters/message_extras), you can annotate your send events with dynamic data from Connected Content, custom attributes (such as language, country), and Canvas entry properties. This Liquid tag appends key-value pairs to the corresponding send event in Currents.

{% alert important %}
This Liquid tag is currently in beta for email, SMS, and push send events. Contact your Braze customer success manager if you're interested in participating in the beta.
{% endalert %}

## New Currents events: users_campaigns_abort and users_canvas_abort
Two new events were added to the Currents glossary: [Canvas abort message events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events#canvas-abort-message-events) and [campaign abort message events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events#campaign-abort-message-events).

## New API endpoints: Catalogs
Use the [Update catalog item]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/catalogs/catalog_items/synchronous/put_update_catalog_item/) and [Update catalog items]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/catalogs/catalog_items/asynchronous/put_update_catalog_items/) endpoints to update an item or multiple items in your catalog.

## Shopify Historical Backfill
[Shopify Historical Backfill]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/ecommerce/shopify_legacy/shopify_features/shopify_backfill) allows Braze to import all customers, orders, and purchase events from the last 90 days prior to your Shopify integration connection.

## WhatsApp
WhatsApp is a popular peer-to-peer messaging platform used across the world offering conversation-based messaging for businesses. The [WhatsApp messaging channel]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp) offers a direct way to engage users on the WhatsApp platform through campaigns, opt-ins and opt-outs, quick replies, and more.

### WhatsApp API object
As part of Braze's WhatsApp support, the `whats_app` object allows you to modify or create WhatsApp messages via our [messaging endpoints]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/messaging). See the [`whats_app` object documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/api/objects_filters/messaging/whats_app_object) for the full spec.

## New Braze partnerships

### Merkury - Analytics
The Braze and [Merkury]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_analytics/customer_data_platform/merkury/) integration allows you to leverage the `MerkuryID` to increase site visitor recognition rates for Braze customers.
