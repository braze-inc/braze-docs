## Orchestration

### SMS Liquid use case

The [Respond with different messages based on inbound SMS keyword]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/liquid_use_cases#sms-keyword-response) use case incorporates dynamic SMS keyword processing to respond to specific inbound messages with different message copy. For example, you can send different responses when someone texts “START” versus “JOIN”.

## Channels & Touchpoints

### SMS character encoding

Our [SMS segment calculator]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms_mms_rcs/segments/#segment-calculator) now has character encoding! Select **Display Character Encoding** to identify which characters are encoded as GSM-7 or UCS-2. 

![SMS segment calculator with a sample SMS message entered in the textbox and the character encoding turned on.]({% image_buster /assets/img/sms/character_encoding.png %}){: style="max-width:70%;"}

### WhatsApp messages with optimization

Because MM API for WhatsApp doesn’t offer 100% deliverability, it's important to understand how to retarget users who may not have received your message on other channels. 

To retarget users, we recommend building a segment of users who didn’t receive a specific message. To do this, filter by the error code `131049`, which indicates that a marketing template message was not sent due to WhatsApp’s per-user marketing template limit enforcement. You can do this by [using Braze Currents or SQL Segment Extensions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/whatsapp_campaign/optimized_delivery/#retargeting-users-on-other-braze-channels).
