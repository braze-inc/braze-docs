# November 11, 2025 release

## Data flexibility

### `Live Activities Push to Start Registered for App` segmentation filter

The [`Live Activities Push to Start Registered for App` filter]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/segmentation_filters#live-activites-push-to-start-registered-for-app) segments your users by whether they are registered to start a Live Activity through iOS push notifications for a specific app.

### RFM SQL Segment Extension

You can create an [RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) Segment Extension]({{site.baseurl}}/rfm_segments/) to target your best users by measuring their purchasing habits.

RFM analysis is a marketing technique that identifies your best users by scoring users on a scale from 0—3 for each category (recency, frequency, monetary), where 3 is the best score and 0 is the worst. Recency, frequency, and monetary values are all based on data from a specific time range of your choosing.

### Custom attributes — Values 

When viewing a usage report, select the [**Values** tab]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/activation/custom_data/custom_attributes/#values-tab) to view the top values of the selected custom attributes based on a sample of approximately 250,000 users.

### Sync logs and observability for Cloud Data Ingestion

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

The Cloud Data Ingestion (CDI) [Sync Log dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/unification/cloud_ingestion/sync_logs/) allows you to monitor all data processed by CDI, verify whether data was synced successfully, and diagnose any issues with “incorrect” or missing data.

### Multi-rule feature flag rollouts

Use [multi-rule feature flag rollouts]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/feature_flags/create/#multi-rule-feature-flag-rollouts) to define a sequence of rules for evaluating users, which allows for precise segmentation and controlled feature releases. This method is ideal for deploying the same feature to diverse audiences.

### Mapping to catalog fields for drag-and-drop product blocks

In your catalog settings, you can select the **Product blocks** toggle to [map to specific fields]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/messaging_fundamentals/product_blocks/#catalog-setup) and information in your catalog. This allows you to select which fields to use as the product title, product URL, and image URL.

### Frequency capping abort events in Currents

When using Currents, you can now reference `abort_type` in the channel abort events. This identifies that a message has been aborted due to frequency capping and includes which frequency capping rule caused the abort. This helps inform how you set up your frequency capping rules. Refer to [Message engagement events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/distribution/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events) for specific Currents event details.

## Robust channels

### Background row images 

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can [add a background row image]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/drag_and_drop/style_settings/#background-image) to an in-app message or landing page in the **Row properties** panel. Toggle on **Background image**, and then provide an image URL or select an image from the [media library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/media_library/). Finally, configure your alt text, size, position, and whether the image repeats to create patterns across the row.

### Copy preview link

Use **Copy preview link** in your [Banners]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/banners/create/#step-5-test-your-message-optional), [email custom footers]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/custom_email_footer/#creating-your-custom-footer), and [email opt-in and unsubscribe pages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/email_settings/?tab=custom%20footer#subscription-pages-and-footers) to generate a shareable link that shows how your content will look like for a random user.

### WhatsApp messages with optimized delivery

Use Meta’s advanced AI systems to deliver your marketing messages to more users who are most likely to engage with them, significantly boosting deliverability and message engagement.

[WhatsApp messages with optimized delivery]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/whatsapp_campaign/optimized_delivery/) are sent using Meta's new [Marketing Messages Lite API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/marketing-messages-lite-api/), which provides superior performance compared to the traditional Cloud API. This new sending pipeline helps you better reach users who value and want to receive your messages.

### WhatsApp Flows

When incorporating a WhatsApp Flow message into a Braze Canvas or campaign, you may want to capture and utilize specific information that users submit through the Flow. Braze needs to receive additional information regarding the structure of the user response, specifically the expected shape of the JSON response, to generate the required nested custom attribute (NCA) schema.

Now you can give Braze the information about the response structure by [saving the Flow response as a custom attribute]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/whatsapp_campaign/whatsapp_flows/?tab=recommended%20method#step-1-generate-the-flow-custom-attribute) and completing a test send.

### Editable user preview

You can [edit individual fields from a random or existing user]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/testing_and_more/sending_test_messages/?tab=webhook#customizing-an-existing-user) to help test dynamic content within your message. Select **Edit** to convert the selected user into a custom user you can modify.

## SDK updates

The following SDK updates have been released. Breaking updates are listed below; all other updates can be found by checking the corresponding SDK changelogs.

- [React Native SDK 18.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/blob/16.1.0/CHANGELOG.md)
    - Fixes the Typescript type for the callback of `subscribeToInAppMessage` and `addListener` for `Braze.Events.IN_APP_MESSAGE_RECEIVED`.
        - These listeners now properly return a callback with the new `InAppMessageEvent` type. Previously, the methods were annotated to return a `BrazeInAppMessage` type, but it was actually returning a `String`.
         - If you are using either subscription API, ensure that the behavior of your in-app messages are unchanged after updating to this version. See our sample code in `BrazeProject.tsx`.
    - The APIs `logInAppMessageClicked`, `logInAppMessageImpression`, and `logInAppMessageButtonClicked` now accept only a `BrazeInAppMessage` object to match its existing public interface.
        - Previously, it would accept both a `BrazeInAppMessage` object as well as a `String`.
    - `BrazeInAppMessage.toString()` now returns a human-readable string instead of the JSON string representation.
        - To get the JSON string representation of an in-app message, use `BrazeInAppMessage.inAppMessageJsonString`.
    - On iOS, `[[BrazeReactUtils sharedInstance] formatPushPayload:withLaunchOptions:]` has been moved to `[BrazeReactDataTranslator formatPushPayload:withLaunchOptions:]`.
        - This new method is a now a class method instead of an instance method.
    - Adds nullability annotations to `BrazeReactUtils` methods.
    - Removes the following deprecated methods and properties from the API:
        - `getInstallTrackingId(callback:)` in favor of `getDeviceId`.
        - `registerAndroidPushToken(token:)` in favor of `registerPushToken`.
        - `setGoogleAdvertisingId(googleAdvertisingId:adTrackingEnabled:)` in favor of `setAdTrackingEnabled`.
        - `PushNotificationEvent.push_event_type` in favor of `payload_type`.
        - `PushNotificationEvent.deeplink` in favor of `url`.
        - `PushNotificationEvent.content_text` in favor of `body`.
        - `PushNotificationEvent.raw_android_push_data` in favor of `android`.
        - `PushNotificationEvent.kvp_data` in favor of `braze_properties`.
