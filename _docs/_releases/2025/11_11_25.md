# November 11, 2025 release

## Data flexibility

### `Live Activites Push to Start Registered for App` segmentation filter

The `Live Activites Push to Start Registered for App` filter segments your users by whether they are registered to start a Live Activity through iOS push notifications for a specific app.

### RFM SQL Segment Extension

You can create an [RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) Segment Extension]({{site.baseurl}}/rfm_segments/) to target your best users by measuring their purchasing habits.

RFM analysis is a marketing technique that identifies your best users by scoring users on a scale from 0—3 for each category (recency, frequency, monetary), where 3 is the best score and 0 is the worst. Recency, frequency, and monetary values are all based on data from a specific time range of your choosing.

### Custom attributes — Values 

When viewing a usage report, select the [**Values** tab]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/activation/custom_data/custom_attributes/#values-tab) to view the top values of the selected custom attributes based on a sample of approxmiately 250,000 users.

## Robust channels

Toggle on **Background image**, and then provide an image URL or select an image from the [media library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/media_library/). Finally, configure your alt text, size, position, and whether the image repeats to create patterns across the row.

### WhatsApp messages with optimized delivery

Use Meta’s advanced AI systems to deliver your marketing messages to more users who are most likely to engage with them, significantly boosting deliverability and message engagement.

[WhatsApp messages with optimized delivery]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/whatsapp_campaign/optimized_delivery/) are sent using Meta's new [Marketing Messages Lite API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/marketing-messages-lite-api/), which provides superior performance compared to the traditional Cloud API. This new sending pipeline helps you better reach users who value and want to receive your messages

### WhatsApp Flows

When incorporating a WhatsApp Flow message into a Braze Canvas or campaign, you may want to capture and utilize specific information that users submit through the Flow. Braze needs to receive additional information regarding the structure of the user response, specifically the expected shape of the JSON response, to generate the required nested custom attribute (NCA) schema.

Now you can give Braze the information about the response structure by [saving the Flow response as a custom attribute]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/whatsapp_campaign/whatsapp_flows/?tab=recommended%20method#step-1-generate-the-flow-custom-attribute) and completing a test send.
