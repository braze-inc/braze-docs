# January 8, 2026 release

## Data flexibility

### eCommerce recommended events

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

To match eCommerce recommended events with the existing purchase event, we added the ["Places Order" conversion event]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/ideas_and_strategies/ecommerce_use_cases/#conversions-report), which is similar to “Makes Purchase".

### Export sync logs by all rows

In the [Cloud Data Ingestion **Sync Log** dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/unification/cloud_ingestion/sync_logs/#exporting-sync-logs), you can choose to export the row-level logs for a sync run by:

* **Rows with errors:** Downloads a file containing only the rows that had an **Error** status.
* **All rows:** Downloads a file containing every row processed in the run.

## Unlocking creativity

## Robust channels

### Bring Your Own (BYO) WhatsApp connector

The [Bring Your Own (BYO) WhatsApp connector]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/overview/byo_connector/) offers a partnership between Braze and Infobip, in which you give Braze access to your Infobip WhatsApp Business Manager (WABA). This allows you to manage and pay for messaging costs directly with Infobip while using Braze for segmentation, personalization, and campaign orchestration. 

### Banners in Canvas

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

You can select **Banners** as a messaging channel in a [Message step]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/message_step) for Canvas. You can use the drag-and-drop editor to create personalized inline messages, providing non-intrusive, contextually relevant experiences that update automatically at the start of each user session. 

### Dynamic BCC

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

With [dynamic BCC]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/email_settings/?tab=bcc%20address#dynamic-bcc), you can use Liquid in your BCC address. Note that this feature is only available in **Email Preferences** and can’t be set on the campaign itself. Only one BCC address per email recipient is allowed.

### Channel-based rate limits

As an alternative to a rate limit that gets shared across an entire multi-channel campaign or Canvas, you can select a specific rate limit per channel. In this case, the rate limit will apply to each of your selected channels. For example, you can set your campaign or Canvas to send a maximum of 5,000 webhooks and 2,500 SMS messages per minute across the campaign or Canvas. For more details, see [Rate limiting and frequency capping]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/building_campaigns/rate-limiting).
