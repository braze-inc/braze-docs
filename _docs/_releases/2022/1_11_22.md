# January 11, 2022 release

Welcome to a new year!

## Canvas Experiment Paths Step
The new Canvas Experiment Paths Step helps track path performance by testing multiple Canvas paths against each other and a control group at any point in the user journey. Now, you can leverage the analytics gathered here to further determine which path is most effective. Read more about how to create a [Experiment Paths Step]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/experiment_step/).

## Handling invalid phone numbers
You've encountered a scenario where a user has entered an invalid phone number. Here's your solution! Braze marks these invalid phone numbers and will not attempt to send any further communications to those numbers. Read more on how Braze [handles invalid phone numbers]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/phone_numbers/user_phone_numbers/#handling-invalid-phone-numbers/).

## New SMS endpoints
You can now manage invalid phone numbers using the new [Braze SMS Endpoints]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/sms/)! This update features:
- [GET: Query or list invalid phone numbers endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/sms/get_query_invalid_numbers/) returns a list of phone numbers that are considered "invalid" by Braze.
- [POST: Remove invalid phone numbers endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/sms/post_remove_invalid_numbers/) allows you to remove the "invalid" phone numbers from Braze's invalid list.

## Rate limits
API rate limits have been included for all [Braze Endpoint articles]({{site.baseurl}}/api/basics/#nav_top_endpoints). You can now easily view the rate limits by request type. For more information on rate limits, check out our article on [API rate limits]({{site.baseurl}}/api/api_limits/).

## New REST endpoint
Braze has added a [new EU-02 REST endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/basics/#api-definitions).
