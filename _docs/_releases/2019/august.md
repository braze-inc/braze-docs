# August 2019

## Campaign details in reports

Your campaign performance report will now list your campaign's details so you don't have to go back through your campaign to see which Delivery, Audience, or Conversion settings you chose while setting up your report.

## New email Content Block API endpoints

You can now manage ([create]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/email_templates/#create-content-block), [list available]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/email_templates/#list-available-content-blocks), [get information]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/email_templates/#see-content-block-information)) your email Content Blocks via API!

## Custom email unsubscribe landing page update

The default [custom email unsubscribe page]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/managing_user_subscriptions/#custom-unsubscribe-landing-page) has been updated with a sleek, more modern look.

## iOS SDK: Notched phone support improvement

Improved support for in-app messages on "notched" devices (for example, iPhone X, Pixel 3XL). Fullscreen messages now expand to fill the entire screen of any phone, while covering the status bar.

You won't see many updates in Braze Docs reflecting this change just yet, but they're on the way!
