# November 2016

## Connected audiences

Connected Audiences allows you to target messages with subsets of your user base on the fly, without any pre-configuration in Braze. For example, a media app can use custom attribute arrays to track every category or TV show that a customer has favorited. Using Connected Audiences, you can connect a custom CMS with Braze and automatically send a push notification or email to anyone who has favorited a show whenever a new episode is released.

Refer to [Connected Audience Object]({{site.baseurl}}/api/objects_filters/connected_audience/) or check out our blog on [Connected Audiences](https://www.braze.com/blog/connected-audiences/).
