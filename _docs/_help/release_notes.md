# Most recent Braze release notes {#most-recent}

> Braze releases information on product updates on a monthly cadence, aligning with major Product Releases, though the product is updated with miscellaneous improvements week to week.
> <br>
> <br>
> For more information on any of the updates listed in this section, reach out to your account manager or [open a support ticket]({{site.baseurl}}/help/support/). You can also check out [our SDK Changelogs]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/sdk_changelogs/) to see more information on our monthly SDK releases, updates, and improvements.

## December 10, 2024 release

### SDK user location by IP address

As of November 26, 2024, Braze will detect user locations from the geolocated country using the IP address from the start of the first SDK session. Braze will use the IP address to set the country value on user profiles that are created via the SDK, and that IP based country setting will be available during and after the first session. Refer to [Location tracking]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/locations_and_geofences/location_tracking/) for more details.

### Elevated Access setting

[Elevated Access]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/company_settings/security_settings/#elevated-access) adds an extra layer of security for sensitive actions in your Braze dashboard. When active, users need to re-verify their account before exporting a segment or viewing an API key. To use Elevated Access, go to **Settings** > **Admin Settings** > **Security Settings** and toggle it on.

### Permission for viewing personally identifiable information (PII)

For admins, you can [allow users to view PII]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_your_braze_users/user_permissions/#list-of-permissions) as defined by your company in the dashboard in message previews that use Liquid variables to access user properties. 

For workspaces, you can allow users to view PII as defined by your company in the dashboard, or view user profiles but redact fields your company has identified as PII.

### Data flexibility

#### Data lake schemas

The following schemas have been added to the raw table schemas:
- `USERS_CANVASSTEP_PROGRESSION_SHARED`: Progression events for a user in a Canvas
- `CHANGELOGS_GLOBALCONTROLGROUP_SHARED`: Identify which random bucket numbers are in the current and previous Global Control Group
- `USERS_MESSAGES_FEATUREFLAG_IMPRESSION_SHARED`: Impression events for when a user views an feature flag

#### Account-based segmentation

You can do [business-to-business (B2B) account-based segmentation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/getting_started/b2b_use_cases/account_based_segmentation/) in two ways, depending on how you set up your B2B data model:

- When using catalogs for your business objects
- When using connected sources for your business objects

#### Segmentation filters

Refer to [Segmentation filters]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/segmentation_filters) for the full list of segmentation filters and their descriptions.

##### User profile created at

Segment your users by when their user profile was created. If a user was added by CSV or API, then this filter reflects the date they were added. If the user isn't added by CSV or API and has their first session tracked by the SDK, then this filter reflects the date of that first session.

##### Sending phone number

Segment your users by the e.164 phone number field. You can use regular expressions with this filter to segment by phone numbers with a specific country code.

### New Braze partnerships

#### Narvar - Ecommerce

The Braze and [Narvar](https://corp.narvar.com/) integration enables brands to leverage Narvar’s notification events to trigger messages directly from Braze, keeping customers informed with timely updates.

#### Zeotap for Currents - Customer data platform

The Braze and [Zeotap](https://zeotap.com/) integration empowers you to extend the scale and reach of your campaigns by syncing Zeotap customer segments to Braze user profiles. With [Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/), you can also connect data to Zeotap to make it actionable across the entire growth stack.

#### Notify - Dynamic content

The Braze and [Notify](https://notifyai.io/) integration empowers marketers to effectively drive engagement across various platforms. Instead of relying on traditional marketing methods, a Braze API-triggered campaign can leverage Notify's capabilities to deliver personalized messaging through multiple channels, including email, SMS, push notifications, and more.

#### Contentful - Dynamic content

The Braze and [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) integration allows you to dynamically use Connected Content to pull content from Contentful into your Braze campaigns.

#### Outgrow - Leads capture 

The Braze and [Outgrow](https://outgrow.co/) integration lets you automatically transfer user data from Outgrow into Braze, enabling highly personalized and targeted campaigns.

## October 15, 2024 release

### Data flexibility

#### Campaigns and Canvases

While creating campaigns and Canvases, you can calculate the exact number of reachable users in your target audience instead of the default estimation by selecting [Calculate exact statistics]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/creating_a_segment/#statistics-for-segment-size).

#### API Android objects

The [`android_priority` parameter]({{site.baseurl}}/api/objects_filters/messaging/android_object/#additional-parameter-details) will accept values either “normal” or “high” to specify the FCM sender priority. By default, notification messages are sent with high priority, and data messages are sent with normal priority.

For more information on how different values impact delivery, see [Android message priority](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/message-priority/).

#### SDK

Use the [Braze SDK's built-in debugger]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_wide/debugging/) to troubleshoot issues for your SDK-powered channels without needing to enable verbose logging in your app.

#### Live Activities

We updated the [frequently asked questions]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/live_activities/faq/) for Swift Live Activities with a few new questions and answers.

#### Custom events

[Event property objects]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_events/#custom-event-properties) that contain array or object values can now have an event property payload of up to 100&nbsp;KB.

#### Random bucket numbers

Use [random audience re-entry with random bucket numbers]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/testing/random_bucket_numbers/#random-audience-re-entry-using-random-bucket-numbers) for A/B testing or targeting specific user groups in your campaigns.

#### Segment Extensions

You can [refresh segment extensions on a recurring schedule]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/segment_extension/#setting-up-a-recurring-refresh) by selecting the frequency at which the extensions will refresh (daily, weekly, or monthly) and the specific time the refresh will occur.

### Robust channels

#### SMS

We added [Adding UTM parameters]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/campaign/link_shortening/#using-link-shortening) to demonstrate how you can use UTM parameters in an SMS message, so you track the performance of campaigns in third-party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics.

#### Landing pages

[Connect your own domain]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/landing_pages/connect_domain/) to your Braze workspace to customize your landing page URLs with your brand.

#### LINE and Braze

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Beta" %}

We added new documentation:

- [LINE message types]({{site.baseurl}}/line/create/message_types/) covers the LINE message types you can compose, including aspects and limitations, and is part of the LINE beta collection.
- [User account linking]({{site.baseurl}}/line/line_setup/#user-account-linking) allows users to link their LINE account to your app’s user account. You can then use Liquid in Braze, such as {% raw %}`{{line_id}}`{% endraw %}, to create a personalized URL for the user that passes the user's LINE ID back to your website or app, which can then be associated with a known user.

#### WhatsApp and Braze

[WhatsApp Business Accounts (WABA)]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/overview/#step-2-whatsapp-setup) can now be shared with multiple Business Solution Providers.

### New Braze partnerships

#### Future Anthem - Dynamic Content

The Braze and [Future Anthem]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_personalization/dynamic_content/future_anthem/) partnership leverages Amplifier AI to deliver content personalization, real-time experiences, and dynamic audiences. Amplifier AI works across sports, casinos, and lottery, allowing you to enhance Braze player profiles with industry-specific player attributes, such as a favorite game, engagement score, expected next bet, and more.

### Settings

#### Indentifier field-level encryption

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Using [identifier field-level encryption]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/field_level_encryption/), you can seamlessly encrypt email addresses with AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to minimize personally identifiable information (PII) shared in Braze. Encryption replaces sensitive data with ciphertext, which is unreadable encrypted information.

### SDK updates

The following SDK updates have been released. Breaking updates are listed below; all other updates can be found by checking the corresponding SDK changelogs.

- [Swift SDK 10.3.1](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#1110)
- [Swift SDK 11.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#1110)
    - Adds support for [Swift 6 strict concurrency checking](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/adoptingswift6)
        - Relevant public Braze classes and data types now conform to the `Sendable` protocol and can be safely used across concurrency contexts.
        - Main thread-only APIs are now marked with the `@MainActor` attribute.
        - We recommend using Xcode 16.0 or later to take advantage of these features while minimizing the number of warnings generated by the compiler. Previous versions of Xcode may still be used, but some features may generate warnings.
    - When integrating push notification support manually, you may need to update the `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` conformance to use the `@preconcurrency` attribute to prevent warnings.
        - Applying the `@preconcurrency` attribute on protocol conformance is only available in Xcode 16.0 or later. Reference our sample integration code [here](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/tree/main/Examples/Swift/Sources/PushNotifications-Manual).
- [React Native SDK 13.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1300)
    - Updates the native Android version bindings from [Braze Android SDK 31.1.0 to 32.1.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/compare/v31.1.0...v32.1.0#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed).
    - Updates the native iOS version bindings from [Braze Swift SDK 10.3.0 to 11.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/compare/10.3.0...11.0.0#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed).
- [Flutter SDK 11.1.0](https://pub.dev/packages/braze_plugin/changelog#1110)
- [Swift SDK 11.1.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#1110)
- [Android SDK 33.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#3300)
    - Updated Kotlin from 1.8 to Kotlin 2.0.
- [Web SDK 5.5.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-web-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#550)

## September 17, 2024 release

### Data flexibility

#### Braze Cloud Data Ingestion for S3

You can use [Cloud Data Ingestion (CDI) for S3]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/cloud_ingestion/file_storage_integrations/#aws-definitions) to directly integrate one or more S3 buckets in your AWS account with Braze. When new files are published to S3, a message is posted to SQS, and Braze Cloud Data Ingestion takes in those new files.

#### Monthly active users CY 24-25

For customers who have purchased Monthly Active Users - CY 24-25, Braze manages different rate limits on its `/users/track` endpoint. For details, refer to [POST: Track Users]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track/#monthly-active-users-cy-24-25). 

### Unlocking creativity

#### Templating catalog items including Liquid

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

Use the `:rerender` flag in a Liquid tag to [render a catalog item's Liquid content]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/catalog/#using-liquid). For example, if you render the following Liquid content:

{% raw %}
```liquid
Hi ${first_name}
{% catalog_items Messages greet_msg :rerender %}
{{ items[0].Welcome_Message }}
```
{% endraw %}

This will display as the following:

{% raw %}
```
Hi Peter,
Welcome to our store, Peter!
```
{% endraw %}

### Robust channels

#### WhatsApp response messages

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can use [response messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/whatsapp_campaign/create#response-messages) to reply to inbound WhatsApp messages from your users. These messages are built in-app on Braze during your composition experience and can be edited at any time. You can use Liquid to match the response message language to the appropriate users.

#### Canvas templates

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Create [Canvas templates]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/canvas_templates/) to refine your messaging by creating a consistent framework that can be easily customized to fit your specific goals across your Canvases.

#### Landing pages

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Beta" %}

Braze [landing pages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/landing_pages) are standalone webpages that can drive your user acquisition and engagement strategy.

#### Changes since last viewed

You can view the number of updates to your [Canvases]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/testing_canvases/measuring_and_testing_with_canvas_analytics/#changes-since-last-viewed), campaigns, and [segments]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/managing_segments/#changes-since-last-viewed) by other members of your team by referring to the *Changes Since Last Viewed* metric on the respective overview pages (such as the overview page for an [email campaign]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/reporting_and_analytics/email_reporting#changes-since-last-viewed)). 

#### Troubleshooting webhook and Connected Content requests 

[This article]({{site.baseurl}}/help/help_articles/api/webhook_connected_content_errors) covers how to troubleshoot webhook and Connected Content error codes, including what the errors are and steps to resolve them.

### New Braze partnerships

#### Inbox Monster - Analytics

[Inbox Monster]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/analytics/inbox_monster/) is an inbox signals platform that helps enterprise brands land every send. It's an integrated suite of solutions for deliverability, creative rendering, and SMS monitoring, that empowers modern customer relationship managment (CRM) teams and ends the sending scaries.

#### SessionM - Loyalty

[SessionM]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/loyalty/sessionm/) is a customer engagement and loyalty platform that provides campaign management features and loyalty management solutions to help marketers drive targeted outreach to increase engagement and profitability.

### AI and ML automation

#### Trending item recommendations

In addition to the "AI Personalized" model, the [AI item recommendations]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/sage_ai/recommendations/about_item_recommendations/#trending) feature also includes a recommendation model for "Trending", which features items that had the most positive momentum when it comes to recent user interactions.

### Settings

#### Roles

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

[Roles]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_your_braze_users/user_permissions/#creating-a-role) allow for more structure by bundling together your individual custom permissions with workspace access controls. This is especially useful if you have many brands or regional workspaces in one dashboard. With roles, you can add dashboard users to the right workspaces and directly grant them the associated permissions. 

#### Security event report

We added a complete list of the [security events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/company_settings/security_settings/#downloading-a-security-event-report) that may appear in your downloaded security report event.

#### Message usage report

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

The [message usage dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/message_usage/) provides self-service insights into your SMS and WhatsApp credit usage for a comprehensive view of historical and current usage compared against contract allotments. These insights can reduce your confusion and help you make adjustments to prevent overage risks.

### SDK

#### Delayed initialization for the Braze Swift SDK

Set up [delayed initialization]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/advanced_use_cases/delayed_initialization/) to initialize your Braze Swift SDK asynchronously while ensuring push notification handling is preserved. This can be useful when you need to set up other services before initializing the SDK, such as fetching configuration data from a server, or waiting for user consent.

## August 20, 2024 release

### New use cases

#### Catalogs

You can bring in any type of data into a catalog. Typically, the data is metadata about offerings, such as products, discounts, promotions, events, and similar. Read our [use cases]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs) and learn how you can use this data to target users with highly relevant messaging.

#### Intelligence Suite

The Intelligence Suite provides powerful features to analyze user history and campaign and Canvas performance, then make automatic adjustments to increase engagement, viewership, and conversions. For a few examples of how these features can benefit different industries, check out our [use cases]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/intelligence).

### Home dashboard update

You can [pick up where you left off]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/analytics/home_dashboard/#pick-up-where-you-left-off) in the Braze dashboard with easy access to files you've recently edited or created. This section appears at the top of the **Home** page of the Braze dashboard.

### Data flexibility

#### Data Transformation templates and new destination

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Build your Data Transformation using our dedicated [template library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/data_transformation/creating_a_transformation#step-2-create-a-transformation) to help you get started with certain external platforms, instead of default code. You can now select **POST: Send messages immediately via API Only** as your destination to transform webhooks from a source platform to send immediate messages to your users.

#### Merge users in bulk

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

If you encounter duplicate user profiles, you can [bulk merge]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/user_profiles/duplicate_users#bulk-merging) these users to help streamline your data.

#### Export custom attributes

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can [export the list of custom attributes]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/#exporting-data) as a CSV file by selecting **Export all** on the **Custom Attributes** page. The CSV file will be generated, and a download link will be emailed to you.

#### Currents IP allowlisting

Braze will send Currents data from the listed IPs, which are automatically and dynamically added to any API keys that have been opted-in for [allowlisting]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/setting_up_currents).

### Robust channels

#### New segment builder experience

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Build a segment using our [updated experience]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/creating_a_segment). Segments update in real-time as data changes, and you can create as many segments as needed for your targeting and messaging purposes.

#### Metrics by segments

Use [Query Builder]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/query_builder/) report templates to break down performance metrics for campaigns, Canvas, variants, and steps by segments.

#### Phone number acquisition

To use the WhatsApp messaging channel, you'll need a phone number that meets WhatsApp’s requirements for its [Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/phone-numbers) or [On-Premises API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/phone-numbers). 

You must acquire your phone number yourself, as Braze won't provision the number for you. You can either purchase a physical phone with a SIM card through your business phone provider or use one of our partners: Twilio or Infoblip. **You must have your own Twilio or Infobip account because this cannot be done through Braze.**

### New Braze partnerships

#### Zendesk Chat - Instant Chat

The Braze and [Zendesk Chat]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/zendesk_chat/) integration uses webhooks from each platform to set up a two-way SMS conversation. When a user requests support, a ticket is created in Zendesk. Agent responses are forwarded to Braze through an API-triggered SMS campaign, and user replies are sent back to Zendesk.

### SDK updates

## July 23, 2024 release

### Braze Docs updates

#### Diátaxis and Braze Docs

We're in the process of standardizing our documentation using a framework called [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/). To help our writers and contributors create content that fits into this new framework, we've created [templates for each content type]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/content_types).

#### New pull-request template for Braze Docs

We took the time to improve our pull-request (PR) template so it's easier and less confusing to [contribute to Braze Docs]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/home/). If you still think there's room for improvement, open up a PR or [submit an issue](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=request_a_feature.md&title=). Whatever's easier!
 
### Data flexibility

#### Export custom events and attributes

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can now export custom event and custom attributes using the [`/custom_attributes`]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/export/custom_attributes/get_custom_attributes) and [`/events`]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/export/custom_events/get_custom_events_data) endpoints.

#### New Currents permissions for users

There are two new permission settings for users: **View Currents Integrations** and **Edit Currents Integrations**. Learn more about [user permissions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_your_braze_users/user_permissions). 

#### Update to Snowflake data retention policy
 
Beginning August 27, 2024, personally identifiable information (PII) will be removed from all Snowflake Secure Data Sharing events data that is older than two years old. If you use Snowflake, you may choose to retain the full events data in your environment by storing a copy in your Snowflake account before the retention policy is applied. Learn more about [Snowflake data retention]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/data_warehouses/snowflake/data_retention/).
 
### Unlocking creativity

#### Multi-page in-app messages

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Adding pages to your in-app message lets you guide users through a sequential flow, like an onboarding flow or welcome journey. To learn more, see [Creating an in-app message with drag-and-drop]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/drag_and_drop/create#multi-page).

#### Link shortening with Liquid

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Use [Liquid to personalize URLs]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/campaign/link_shortening/#enabling-link-shortening) to automatically shorten URLs contained in SMS messages and collect click-through-rate analytics. To try it out, see [Link shortening]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/campaign/link_shortening/).

#### API examples for catalogs

We've added examples for the `/catalogs` endpoint using array fields. To see the examples, check out the following:

- [Edit multiple catalog items]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/catalogs/catalog_items/asynchronous/patch_catalog_items_bulk)

You can now add multiple WhatsApp Business accounts and subscription groups (and phone numbers) to each workspace. For details, see [Multiple WhatsApp Business accounts]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/overview/multiple_subscription_groups). 

#### SMS Geographic Permissions

SMS Geographic Permissions enhance security and protect against fraudulent SMS traffic by enforcing controls on the countries to which you can send SMS messages. To learn how to specify an allowlist of countries so you can make sure SMS messages are only sent to approved regions, see [Configuring your SMS country allowlist]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/sms_geographic_permissions/#configuring-your-sms-country-allowlist).

#### LINE and Braze

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Beta" %}

[LINE](https://www.lycbiz.com/sites/default/files/media/jp/download/LINE%20Business%20Guide_202310-202403.pdf) is the most popular messaging app in Japan, with over 95 million monthly active users. You can integrate your LINE accounts with Braze to leverage your zero- and first-party customer data to send compelling LINE messages to the right customers based on their preferences, behaviors, and cross-channel interactions. To get started, see [LINE]({{site.baseurl}}/line).

### AI and ML automation
 
#### Rules-based merging for duplicate users

Previoulsy, you could find and merge duplicate users in Braze individually or in bulk. Now you can create rules to control how duplicates are resolved, so the most relevant user is kept. To learn more, see [Rules-based merging]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/user_profiles/duplicate_users/#rules-based-merging).

#### AI Liquid assistant

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Beta" %}

The AI Liquid Assistant is a chat assistant powered by BrazeAI<sup>TM</sup> that helps generate the Liquid you need to personalize message content. You can generate Liquid from templates, receive personalized Liquid suggestions, and optimize existing Liquid with the support of BrazeAI<sup>TM</sup>. The AI Liquid Assistant also provides annotations explaining the Liquid used, so you can increase your understanding of Liquid and learn to write your own.

To get started, see [AI Liquid assistant]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/generative_ai/ai_liquid).
 
### SDK
 
#### Android SDK logs

We overhauled the [logging docs for the Braze Android SDK]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/initial_sdk_setup/additional_customization_and_configuration/#logging), so it's easier to read and use in your app. We also added descriptions for each log level.

#### iOS SDK foreground push notifications

The `subscribeToUpdates` method in the Braze iOS SDK can now detect if a foreground push notification is received. To learn more, see [iOS push notification integration]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/push_notifications/integration).
 
#### Updating the Xamarin docs
 
Since [version 4.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-xamarin-sdk/releases/tag/4.0.0), the Braze Xamarin SDK uses the Swift SDK binding, so we updated the code snippets and reference material. We also restructured the section to make it easier to read and understand. To check it out, see [the Xamarin docs]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/xamarin/initial_sdk_setup).

#### SDK updates

The following SDK updates have been released. Breaking updates are listed below; all other updates can be found by checking the corresponding SDK changelogs.
 
- [Swift SDK 9.3.1](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/releases/tag/9.3.1)

### Data flexibility

#### Attachments for API-triggered campaigns

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

The [`/campaigns/trigger/send` endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/messaging/send_messages/post_send_triggered_campaigns) now supports attachments (just like the `/messages/send` endpoint supports attachments for emails). 

#### Additional data warehouse support

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

Braze [Cloud Data Ingestion (CDI)]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/cloud_ingestion/connected_sources) now supports BigQuery, Databricks, Redshift, and Snowflake.

#### WhatsApp phone number migration

Migrate your WhatsApp phone number between WhatsApp Business Accounts by using Meta's Embedded Signup. Read more about [WhatsApp phone number migration]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/overview/phone_number_migration).
 
### Unlocking creativity

#### Engagement by Device

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

The new **Engagement by Device** report provides a breakdown of what devices your users are using to engage with your email. This data tracks email engagement across mobile, desktop, tablet, and other device types.

#### WhatsApp and SMS Liquid properties in Canvas flow

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

We added support for [WhatsApp and SMS Liquid properties in Canvas flow]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/canvas_entry_properties_event_properties). Now, when an Action Path step contains a "Sent an SMS Inbound Message" or "Sent a WhatsApp Inbound Message" trigger, the subsequent Canvas steps can include an SMS or WhatsApp Liquid property. This mirrors how event properties work in Canvas Flow. This way you can leverage your messages to save and reference first-party data on user profiles and conversational messaging.
 
#### Personalized Paths in recurring Canvases

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

Personalized Paths in Canvases let you personalize any point of a Canvas journey for individual users based on conversion likelihood. Now, Personalized Paths are available for recurring Canvases.

### Visual updates to documentation site

You may have noticed our documentation website has a snazzy new look! We've revamped it to reflect the new vibrant Braze brand identity. For a behind-the-scenes look at our new brand, read more at [Unveiling Our New Brand: A Conversation with Braze Executive Creative Director Greg Erdelyi](https://www.braze.com/resources/articles/unveiling-our-new-brand-a-conversation-with-braze-executive-creative-director-greg-erdelyi).

### Support for Portuguese and Spanish

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Braze is now available in both Portuguese and Spanish. To change the language the Braze dashboard appears in, refer to [Language settings]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/language/).

### Robust channels

#### Multi-language settings

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

By adjusting [multi-language settings]({{site.baseurl}}/multi_language_support/), you can target users in different languages and locations with different messages all within a single email message. To edit and manage multi-language support, you must have the "Manage Multi-Language Settings" user permission. To add the locale to a message, you'll need permissions for editing campaigns.

#### Message-level one-click list-unsubscribe header

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

The one-click unsubscribe for the list-unsubscribe header ([RFC 8058](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8058)) provides an easy way for recipients to opt-out from emails. You can adjust this header setting to be applied at a message level in your emails. For more information on this setting, refer to [Email unsubscribe header in workspaces]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/email_settings/#email-unsubscribe-header-in-workspaces).

#### About email sanitization
