# Most recent Braze release notes {#most-recent}

> Braze releases information on product updates on a monthly cadence, aligning with major Product Releases, though the product is updated with miscellaneous improvements week to week.
> <br>
> <br>
> For more information on any of the updates listed in this section, reach out to your account manager or [open a support ticket]({{site.baseurl}}/help/support/). You can also check out [our SDK Changelogs]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/sdk_changelogs/) to see more information on our monthly SDK releases, updates, and improvements.

## September 17, 2024 release

### Data flexibility

#### Braze Cloud Data Ingestion for S3

You can use [Cloud Data Ingestion (CDI) for S3]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/cloud_ingestion/file_storage_integrations/#aws-definitions) to directly integrate one or more S3 buckets in your AWS account with Braze. When new files are published to S3, a message is posted to SQS, and Braze Cloud Data Ingestion takes in those new files.

#### Increased rate limit

The rate limit for the [/users/export/ids]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/export/user_data/post_users_identifier) request type has increased to 2,500 requests per minute.

#### Monthly active users CY 24-25

For customers who have purchased Monthly Active Users - CY 24-25, Braze manages different rate limits on its `/users/track` endpoint. For details, refer to [POST: Track Users]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track/#monthly-active-users-cy-24-25). 

### Unlocking creativity

#### Templating catalog items including Liquid

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

Use the `:rerender` flag in a Liquid tag to [render a catalog item's Liquid content]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/catalog/#using-liquid). For example, if you render the following Liquid content:

{% raw %}
```liquid
Hi ${first_name}
{% catalog_items Messages greet_msg :rerender %}
{{ items[0].Welcome_Message }}
```
{% endraw %}

This will display as the following:

{% raw %}
```
Hi Peter,
Welcome to our store, Peter!
```
{% endraw %}

### Robust channels

#### WhatsApp response messages

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can use [response messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/whatsapp_campaign/create#response-messages) to reply to inbound WhatsApp messages from your users. These messages are built in-app on Braze during your composition experience and can be edited at any time. You can use Liquid to match the response message language to the appropriate users.

#### Canvas templates

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Create [Canvas templates]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/canvas_templates/) to refine your messaging by creating a consistent framework that can be easily customized to fit your specific goals across your Canvases.

#### Landing pages

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Beta" %}

Braze [landing pages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/landing_pages) are standalone webpages that can drive your user acquisition and engagement strategy.

#### Changes since last viewed

You can view the number of updates to your [Canvases]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/testing_canvases/measuring_and_testing_with_canvas_analytics/#changes-since-last-viewed), campaigns, and [segments]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/managing_segments/#changes-since-last-viewed) by other members of your team by referring to the *Changes Since Last Viewed* metric on the respective overview pages (such as the overview page for an [email campaign]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/reporting_and_analytics/email_reporting#changes-since-last-viewed)). 

#### Troubleshooting webhook and Connected Content requests 

[This article]({{site.baseurl}}/help/help_articles/api/webhook_connected_content_errors) covers how to troubleshoot webhook and Connected Content error codes, including what the errors are and steps to resolve them.

### New Braze partnerships

#### Inbox Monster - Analytics

[Inbox Monster]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/analytics/inbox_monster/) is an inbox signals platform that helps enterprise brands land every send. It's an integrated suite of solutions for deliverability, creative rendering, and SMS monitoring, that empowers modern customer relationship managment (CRM) teams and ends the sending scaries.

#### SessionM - Loyalty

[SessionM]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/loyalty/sessionm/) is a customer engagement and loyalty platform that provides campaign management features and loyalty management solutions to help marketers drive targeted outreach to increase engagement and profitability.

### AI and ML automation

#### Trending item recommendations

In addition to the "AI Personalized" model, the [AI item recommendations]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/sage_ai/recommendations/about_item_recommendations/#trending) feature also includes a recommendation model for "Trending", which features items that had the most positive momentum when it comes to recent user interactions.

### Settings

#### Roles

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

[Roles]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_your_braze_users/user_permissions/#creating-a-role) allow for more structure by bundling together your individual custom permissions with workspace access controls. This is especially useful if you have many brands or regional workspaces in one dashboard. With roles, you can add dashboard users to the right workspaces and directly grant them the associated permissions. 

#### Security event report

We added a complete list of the [security events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/company_settings/security_settings/#downloading-a-security-event-report) that may appear in your downloaded security report event.

#### Message usage report

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

The [message usage dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/message_usage/) provides self-service insights into your SMS and WhatsApp credit usage for a comprehensive view of historical and current usage compared against contract allotments. These insights can reduce your confusion and help you make adjustments to prevent overage risks.

### SDK

#### Delayed initialization for the Braze Swift SDK

Set up [delayed initialization]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/advanced_use_cases/delayed_initialization/) to initialize your Braze Swift SDK asynchronously while ensuring push notification handling is preserved. This can be useful when you need to set up other services before initializing the SDK, such as fetching configuration data from a server, or waiting for user consent.

## August 20, 2024 release

### New use cases

#### Catalogs

You can bring in any type of data into a catalog. Typically, the data is metadata about offerings, such as products, discounts, promotions, events, and similar. Read our [use cases]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs) and learn how you can use this data to target users with highly relevant messaging.

#### Intelligence Suite

The Intelligence Suite provides powerful features to analyze user history and campaign and Canvas performance, then make automatic adjustments to increase engagement, viewership, and conversions. For a few examples of how these features can benefit different industries, check out our [use cases]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/intelligence).

### Home dashboard update

You can [pick up where you left off]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/analytics/home_dashboard/#pick-up-where-you-left-off) in the Braze dashboard with easy access to files you've recently edited or created. This section appears at the top of the **Home** page of the Braze dashboard.

### Data flexibility

#### Data Transformation templates and new destination

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Build your Data Transformation using our dedicated [template library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/data_transformation/creating_a_transformation#step-2-create-a-transformation) to help you get started with certain external platforms, instead of default code. You can now select **POST: Send messages immediately via API Only** as your destination to transform webhooks from a source platform to send immediate messages to your users.

#### Merge users in bulk

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

If you encounter duplicate user profiles, you can [bulk merge]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/user_profiles/duplicate_users#bulk-merging) these users to help streamline your data.

#### Export custom attributes

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can [export the list of custom attributes]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/#exporting-data) as a CSV file by selecting **Export all** on the **Custom Attributes** page. The CSV file will be generated, and a download link will be emailed to you.

#### Currents IP allowlisting

Braze will send Currents data from the listed IPs, which are automatically and dynamically added to any API keys that have been opted-in for [allowlisting]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/setting_up_currents).

### Robust channels

#### New segment builder experience

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Build a segment using our [updated experience]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/creating_a_segment). Segments update in real-time as data changes, and you can create as many segments as needed for your targeting and messaging purposes.

#### Metrics by segments

Use [Query Builder]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/query_builder/) report templates to break down performance metrics for campaigns, Canvas, variants, and steps by segments.

#### Phone number acquisition

To use the WhatsApp messaging channel, you'll need a phone number that meets WhatsApp’s requirements for its [Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/phone-numbers) or [On-Premises API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/phone-numbers). 

You must acquire your phone number yourself, as Braze won't provision the number for you. You can either purchase a physical phone with a SIM card through your business phone provider or use one of our partners: Twilio or Infoblip. **You must have your own Twilio or Infobip account because this cannot be done through Braze.**

### New Braze partnerships

#### Zendesk Chat - Instant Chat

The Braze and [Zendesk Chat]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/zendesk_chat/) integration uses webhooks from each platform to set up a two-way SMS conversation. When a user requests support, a ticket is created in Zendesk. Agent responses are forwarded to Braze through an API-triggered SMS campaign, and user replies are sent back to Zendesk.

### SDK updates

The following SDK updates have been released. Breaking updates are listed below; all other updates can be found by checking the corresponding SDK changelogs.

- [Android SDK 32.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

    - Updated the iOS binding from [Braze Swift SDK 9.0.0 to 10.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/compare/9.0.0...10.0.0#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed).
        - When subscribing to push notification events, the subscription will be triggered on iOS for both "Push Received" and "Push Opened", instead of only for "Push Opened" events.

## July 23, 2024 release

### Braze Docs updates

#### Diátaxis and Braze Docs

We're in the process of standardizing our documentation using a framework called [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/). To help our writers and contributors create content that fits into this new framework, we've created [templates for each content type]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/content_types).

#### New pull-request template for Braze Docs

We took the time to improve our pull-request (PR) template so it's easier and less confusing to [contribute to Braze Docs]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/home/). If you still think there's room for improvement, open up a PR or [submit an issue](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=request_a_feature.md&title=). Whatever's easier!
 
### Data flexibility

#### Export custom events and attributes

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can now export custom event and custom attributes using the [`/custom_attributes`]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/export/custom_attributes/get_custom_attributes) and [`/events`]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/export/custom_events/get_custom_events_data) endpoints.

#### New Currents permissions for users

There are two new permission settings for users: **View Currents Integrations** and **Edit Currents Integrations**. Learn more about [user permissions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_your_braze_users/user_permissions). 

#### Update to Snowflake data retention policy
 
Beginning August 27, 2024, personally identifiable information (PII) will be removed from all Snowflake Secure Data Sharing events data that is older than two years old. If you use Snowflake, you may choose to retain the full events data in your environment by storing a copy in your Snowflake account before the retention policy is applied. Learn more about [Snowflake data retention]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/data_warehouses/snowflake/data_retention/).
 
### Unlocking creativity

#### Multi-page in-app messages

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Adding pages to your in-app message lets you guide users through a sequential flow, like an onboarding flow or welcome journey. To learn more, see [Creating an in-app message with drag-and-drop]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/drag_and_drop/create#multi-page).

#### Link shortening with Liquid

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Use [Liquid to personalize URLs]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/campaign/link_shortening/#enabling-link-shortening) to automatically shorten URLs contained in SMS messages and collect click-through-rate analytics. To try it out, see [Link shortening]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/campaign/link_shortening/).

#### API examples for catalogs

We've added examples for the `/catalogs` endpoint using array fields. To see the examples, check out the following:

- [Edit multiple catalog items]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/catalogs/catalog_items/asynchronous/patch_catalog_items_bulk)
- [Create multiple catalog items]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/catalogs/catalog_items/asynchronous/post_create_catalog_items_bulk)

### Robust channels

### Multiple WhatsApp Business accounts

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can now add multiple WhatsApp Business accounts and subscription groups (and phone numbers) to each workspace. For details, see [Multiple WhatsApp Business accounts]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/overview/multiple_subscription_groups). 

#### SMS Geographic Permissions

Google is updating their [EU User Consent Policy](https://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy/) in response to changes to the [Digital Markets Act (DMA)](https://ads-developers.googleblog.com/2023/10/updates-to-customer-match-conversion.html), which is in effect as of March 6, 2024. This new change requires advertisers to disclose certain information to their EEA and UK end users, as well as obtain necessary consents from them. As part of this upcoming change, you can [collect both consent signals in Braze as custom attributes]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/canvas_steps/google_audience_sync/#collecting-consent-for-eea-and-uk-end-users). Braze will sync the data from these custom attributes to the appropriate consent fields in Google.

### Data flexibility

#### Merge duplicate users

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

In the Braze dashboard, you can now [search for and merge duplicate users]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/user_profiles/duplicate_users) to maximize the effectiveness of your campaigns and Canvases. You can individually merge user profiles or perform a bulk merge, which merges all profiles with matching identifiers into the most recently updated user profile.

#### Search for archived content

In the Braze dashboard, you can now include [archived content in your search results]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/global_search/#filter-for-archived-content) by selecting **Show Archived Content**.

#### Message archiving support for AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage

You can use [message archiving]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/export_braze_data/message_archiving/) to save a copy of your messages sent to users for archival or compliance purposes to your AWS S3 bucket, Azure Blob Storage container or Google Cloud Storage bucket.

#### SQL table reference

Visit the [SQL table reference]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/sql_segments/sql_segments_tables/) to see the tables and columns available to be queried in the Query Builder or when generating SQL Segment Extensions.

### Unlocking creativity

#### Tone control for AI copywriting

You can now choose a [message tone]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/generative_ai/ai_copywriting/#steps) to determine the style of the copy generated with the AI copywriting assistant.

### Robust channels

#### Card creation

You can choose when Braze evaluates audience eligibility and personalization for new Content Card campaigns and Canvas steps by specifying when the card is [created]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/create/card_creation/). 

#### Preview user paths

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Experience the Canvas journey you’ve created for your users, including previewing the timing and messages they will receive. These [test runs]({{site.baseurl}}/preview_user_paths/) act as quality assurance that your messages are sent to the right audience, all before sending the Canvas.

#### Quick push campaigns

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

When creating a push campaign in Braze, you can select multiple platforms and devices to craft one message for all platforms in a single editing experience called [quick push]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/push/creating_a_push_message/quick_push/). This feature is only available for campaigns.

#### Custom list-unsubscribe header

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Adding a [custom list-unsubscribe header]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/email_settings/#custom-list-unsubscribe-header) to your email messaging allows your recipients to opt-out. This way, you can add your own configured one-click unsubscribe endpoint and an optional “mailto:”. Braze requires an input for URL to support a custom list-unsubscribe header because the one-click unsubscribe HTTP is a requirement from Yahoo and Gmail for bulk senders.

#### Multiple pages for in-app messages

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

[Adding pages to your in-app message]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/drag_and_drop/create/#multi-page) lets you guide users through a sequential flow, like an onboarding flow or welcome journey. You can manage pages from the **Pages** section of the **Build** tab.

#### Randomize paths for an experiment path

To always [randomize path assignment]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/experiment_step) for an Experiment Path step, select **Randomized Paths in Experiment Paths** in the step. This option is not available when using either Winning or Personalized Paths.

#### Email capture form

[Email capture messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/traditional/customize/email_capture_form/) allow you to easily prompt users of your site to submit their email address, after which it will be available in their user profile for use in all your messaging campaigns.
