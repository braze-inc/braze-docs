# Most recent Braze release notes {#most-recent}

> Braze releases information on product updates on a monthly cadence, aligning with major Product Releases, though the product is updated with miscellaneous improvements week to week.<br><br>For more information on any of the updates listed in this section, reach out to your account manager or [open a support ticket]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/support/). You can also check out [our SDK Changelogs]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/changelogs) to see more information on our monthly SDK releases, updates, and improvements.

## July 22, 2025 release

### Security events export with Amazon S3

You can automatically [export Security Events to Amazon S3]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/company_settings/security_settings/security_export_s3/), a cloud storage provider, with a daily job that runs at midnight UTC. Once set up, you don't need to manually export Security Events from the dashboard.

### Data flexibility

#### CSV import

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can use CSV import to record and update user attributes and custom events in Braze like `first_name`, `last_destination_searched`, and `trip_booked`. To get started, see [CSV Import]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/user_data_collection/user_import/csv_import).

#### API usage alerts

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

API usage alerts provide critical visibility into your API usage, allowing you to proactively detect unexpected traffic. By setting up these alerts to track key API request volumes, you can receive real-time notifications and address problems before they impact your marketing campaigns.

#### Workspace rate limits

With workspace rate limits, you can set a maximum number of API requests a workspace can make to a specific ingestion endpoint, such as `/users/track` or SDK data. You can also apply rate limits to a group of workspaces, meaning the limit is shared across all the workspaces in that group.

#### New Currents events

These new events were added to the Currents glossary:

- [Banner Abort events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events/#banner-abort-events)
- [Banner Click events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events/#banner-click-events)
- [Banner Impression events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events/#banner-impression-events)
- [Banner Viewed events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events/#banner-viewed-events)
- [Webhook Failure events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events/#webhook-failure-events)

#### Default time range for campaign analytics

By default, the time range for [**Campaign Analytics**]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/reporting/campaign_analytics/) will display the last 90 days from the current time. This means that if the campaign was launched more than 90 days ago, the analytics will display as "0" for the given time range. To view all analytics for older campaigns, adjust the reporting time range.

#### Updated behavior for Canvas Experiment Paths step

If your Canvas has an active or in-progress [experiment]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/experiment_step) and you update the active Canvas (even if it's not to the Experiment Path step), the in-progress experiment will end. To restart the experiment, you can disconnect the existing Experiment Path and launch a new one, or duplicate the Canvas and launch a new Canvas. 

For more information, refer to [Editing Canvases after launch]({{site.baseurl}}/post-launch_edits/).

#### Faster rate limit available for `/users/export/ids` endpoint

You can also increase the [rate limit for the /users/export/ids endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/export/user_data/post_users_identifier/#rate-limit) to 40 requests per second by meeting the following requirements:

- Your workspace has the default rate limit (250 requests per minute) enabled. Contact your Braze account manager for further assistance with removing any pre-existing rate limit you may have.
- Your request includes the fields_to_export parameter to list out all the fields you want to receive.

#### New translation for email templates endpoints

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

Use these endpoints to view and make updates to translations and locales for email templates:

- [GET: View the source translations]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/translations/email_templates/get_view_source_template)
- [GET: View a specific translation and locale for email template endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/translations/email_templates/get_view_translation_locale_template)
- [GET: View all translations and locales for an email template]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/translations/email_templates/get_view_translation_template)
- [PUT: Update translations for an email template]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/translations/email_templates/put_update_template)

### Unlocking creativity

#### Landing pages

You can make your landing page [responsive to the size of a user's device]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/landing_pages/creating_pages#step-3-customize-the-page) by vertically stacking columns on smaller screens. To enable this, add a column into the row you want to make responsive, and then toggle on **Vertically stack on smaller screens** in the **Customize columns** section.

### Robust channels

#### Self-serve custom domains

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

[Self-serve custom domains]({{site.baseurl}}/custom_domains/) empower you to configure and manage your own custom domains for SMS, RCS, and WhatsApp directly from your Braze dashboard. You can easily add, monitor, and manage up to 10 custom domains in one place.

#### Bot filtering for emails

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Set up bot filtering in your [Email Preferences]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/email_settings) to exclude all suspected machine or bot clicks. A "bot click" in email refers to a click on hyperlinks within an email that's generated by an automated program. By filtering these bot clicks, you can intentionally trigger and deliver messages to recipients who are engaged.

#### Drag-and-drop product blocks

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

The [drag-and-drop editor]({{site.baseurl}}/dnd_product_blocks/) empowers you to quickly add and configure product blocks to your messages for seamless product showcases, without the need to create custom Liquid code. The drag-and-drop product block feature is currently only available for email.

#### Span text for landing pages and in-app messages

Span text allows you to apply specific styling to text blocks without custom code for your [landing pages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/landing_pages/creating_pages/#step-3-customize-the-page) and [in-app messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/drag_and_drop/style_settings/#blocks). To do so, highlight the text you want to style and then select **Wrap with span for style**. 

#### Ad Click to WhatsApp

[Ads That Click to WhatsApp]({{site.baseurl}}/whatsapp_use_cases/) are an efficient way to bring both new and existing customers from Meta ads on Facebook, Instagram, or other platforms. Use these ads to promote your products and services while making users aware of your WhatsApp presence. 

### New Braze partnerships

#### Shopify Visitory API — eCommerce

Braze collects visitor information, such as email addresses and phone numbers, through in-browser messages. This information is then sent to Shopify. This data helps merchants recognize visitors to their store and create a more personalized shopping experience.

#### Okendo — eCommerce

The Braze and [Okendo]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/okendo/) integration works across multiple products in Okendo's platform, including Reviews, Loyalty, Referrals, Surveys, and Quizzes. Okendo sends custom events and user attributes to Braze, which can be used to personalize and trigger messages.

#### Lemnisk — Customer Data Platform

The Braze and [Lemnisk]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/lemnisk/) integration allows brands and enterprises to unlock the full potential of Braze by acting as a CDP-led intelligence layer that unifies user data across platforms in real time, and sending the user's information and behaviors collected to Braze in real-time.

### SDK updates

The following SDK updates have been released. Breaking updates are listed below; all other updates can be found by checking the corresponding SDK changelogs.

- [Web SDK 6.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-web-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
    - Removed the `Banner.html` property, `logBannerClick`, and `logBannerImpressions` methods. Instead, use [`insertBanner`](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/modules/braze.html#insertbanner) which automatically handles impression and click tracking.
    - Removed support for the legacy News Feed feature. This includes removal of the Feed class, and its associated methods.
    - The created and categories fields that were used by legacy News Feed cards have been removed from [`Card`](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/classes/braze.card.html) subclasses.
    - The linkText field was also removed from the [`ImageOnly`](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/classes/braze.imageonly.html) Card subclass and its constructor.
    - Clarified definitions and updated types to note that certain SDK methods explicitly return undefined when the SDK is not initialized, aligning the typings with actual runtime behavior. This could introduce new TypeScript errors in projects that relied on the previous (incomplete) typings.
    - The images of in-app messages with `cropType` of `CENTER_CROP` (such as `FullScreenMessage` by default) are now rendered via an `<img>` tag instead of `<span>` for improved accessibility. This may break existing CSS customizations for the `.ab-center-cropped-img` class or its children.
- [Cordova SDK 13.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-cordova-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1300)
    - Updated the internal iOS implementation of `enableSdk` method to use setEnabled: instead of `_requestEnableSDKOnNextAppRun`, which was deprecated in the Swift SDK.
        - Calling this method no longer requires the app to be re-launched to take effect. The SDK will now become enabled as soon as this method is executed.
    - Updated the native Android bridge [from Braze Android SDK 36.0.0 to 37.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/compare/v36.0.0...v37.0.0#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed).
- [Android SDK 37.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- [Swift SDK 12.0.1-12.1.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## June 24, 2025 release

### OfferFit by Braze

[OfferFit](https://www.offerfit.ai/) replaces A/B testing with AI decisioning that personalizes everything, and maximizes any metric: drive dollars, not clicks—with OfferFit, you can optimize any business KPI. Refer to our dedicated section [OfferFit by Braze]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/offerfit) for sample use cases and key features.

### New SDK tutorials

Each Braze SDK tutorial offers step-by-step instructions along with full sample code. Choose a tutorial below to get started:

- [Displaying Banners]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/banners/tutorial_displaying_banners)
- [Customizing in-app message styling]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/in_app_messages/tutorials/customizing_message_styling)
- [Conditionally displaying in-app messages]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/in_app_messages/tutorials/conditionally_displaying_messages)
- [Deferring triggered in-app messages]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/in_app_messages/tutorials/deferring_triggered_messages)

### Data flexibility

#### SAML just-in-time provisioning

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Use [SAML just-in-time provisioning]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/single_sign_on/saml_jit) to allow new dashboard users to create a Braze account on their first sign in. This eliminates the need for administrators to manually create an account for a new dashboard user, choose their permissions, assign them to a workspace, and wait for them to activate their account.

#### Filters per selection

You can now add up to 10 filters per [selection]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/selections).

#### Catalog storage

The storage size for the free version of [catalogs]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/catalog/#catalog-storage) is up to 100&nbsp;MB. You can have unlimited items as long as they're under 100&nbsp;MB.

#### Number of rows synced with Cloud Data Ingestion

By default, for Cloud Data Ingestion, each run can sync up to 500 million rows. Any syncs with more than 500 million new rows will be stopped.

Refer to [Cloud Data Ingestion product limitations]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/cloud_ingestion/overview/#product-limitations) for more details.

### Robust channels

#### Accessibility testing in Inbox Vision

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Use [Accessibility testing]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/inbox_vision/#accessibility-testing) in Inbox Vision to highlight accessibility issues that may exist with your email. 

Accessibility testing analyzes your email content against some [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (WCAG) 2.2 AA requirements. This can provide insights into which elements aren't meeting accessibility standards.

#### Click tracking for WhatsApp

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can turn on [click tracking]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/whatsapp_campaign/click_tracking) in both response and template messages to see click data in your WhatsApp performance reports and be able to segment users based on who clicked what.

#### Videos for WhatsApp

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can [embed videos]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/whatsapp_campaign/create/#supported-whatsapp-features) within the body text for outbound WhatsApp messages. These files must be hosted through URL or in the [Braze media library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/media_library).

### New Braze partnerships

#### Stripe - eCommerce

The Braze and [Stripe]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/stripe) intergation allows you to trigger messaging in Braze based on Stripe events such as trial started, subscription activated, subscription cancellation, and more.

### SDK updates

The following SDK updates have been released. Breaking updates are listed below; all other updates can be found by checking the corresponding SDK changelogs.

- [React Native SDK 15.0.1](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- [Flutter SDK 14.0.1-14.0.2](https://pub.dev/packages/braze_plugin/changelog)

    - Updated the native Android bridge [from Braze Android SDK 35.0.0 to 36.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/compare/v35.0.0...v36.0.0#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed).
    - Updated the native iOS bridge [from Braze Swift SDK 11.6.1 to 12.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/compare/11.6.1...12.0.0#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed).
- [Segment Kotlin 4.0.0-4.0.1](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-segment-kotlin/blob/4.0.0/CHANGELOG.md#400)
    - Updated Braze Android SDK [from 35.0.0 to 36.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/compare/v35.0.0...v36.0.0#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed)

## May 27, 2025 release

### Data flexibility

#### Copying Canvases across workspaces

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can now copy Canvases across workspaces. This lets you jumpstart your message composition by starting with a copy of a Canvas in a different workspace. For more information on what's copied over, refer to [Copying campaigns and Canvases across workspaces]({{site.baseurl}}/copying_to_workspaces/).

#### Messaging rules for approval workflow 

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Use [messaging rules]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/messaging_fundamentals/approvals/messaging_rules) in your approval workflow to limit the number of reachable users before an additional approval is required—this way, you can review your campaigns and Canvases before you target a larger audience.

#### Entity relationship diagrams for Snowflake and Braze

Earlier this year, we created entity relationship tables for data shared between Snowflake and Braze. This month, we added [new interactive diagrams]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_analytics/data_warehouses/snowflake/entity_relationships/) where you can pan, grab, and zoom into the details of each table, giving you a better idea of how your data interacts with Braze.

### Unlocking creativity

#### Recommended events

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

[Recommended events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/custom_data/recommended_events) map to the most common eCommerce use cases. By using recommended events, you can unlock pre-built Canvas templates, reporting dashboards that map to the customer lifecycle, and more.

### Robust channels

#### Banners channel

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

With [Banners]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/banners), you can create personalized messaging for your users, all while extending the reach of your other channels, such as email or push notifications. You can embed Banners directly in your app or website, which lets you engage with users through an experience that feels natural.

#### Rich Communication Services (RCS) channel

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

[Rich Communication Services (RCS)]({{site.baseurl}}/about_rcs/) enhances traditional SMS by enabling brands to deliver messages that are not only informative but also far more engaging. Now supported on both Android and iOS, RCS brings features like high-quality media, interactive buttons, and branded sender profiles directly into users’ pre-installed messaging apps, eliminating the need to download a separate app.

#### Push Settings page

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Use the [**Push Settings** page]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/push_settings) to configure key settings for your push notifications, including the Push Time to Live (TTL) and the default FCM priority for Android campaigns. These settings help optimize the delivery and effectiveness of your push notifications, ensuring a better experience for your users.

#### Promotion codes for in-app message campaigns

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

You can use [promotion codes]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/promotion_codes) in in-app message campaigns by inserting a [promotion code list snippet]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/promotion_codes#creating-a-promotion-code-list) into the message body of your in-app message campaign.

#### Handling webhook errors and rate limiting

[About webhooks]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/webhooks/understanding_webhooks/#webhook-error-handling-and-rate-limiting) has a new section that describes how Braze handles webhook errors and rate limiting.

#### In-app message locales

After [adding locales]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/using_locales) to your workspace, you can target users in different languages all within a single in-app message.

#### Amazon SES as an Email Sending Provider (ESP)

You can now use Amazon SES as an ESP, similar to how you would use SendGrid and SparkPost. Refer to [SSL at Braze]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/email_setup/ssl#what-is-a-cdn-and-why-do-i-need-it) and [Universal Links and App Links]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/universal_links#turning-off-click-tracking-on-a-link-to-link-basis) for nuances in SSL set up and click-tracking on a link-to-link basis.

### New Braze partnerships

#### Eagle Eye - Loyalty

The Braze and [Eagle Eye]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/eagle_eye/) bi-directional integration allows you to activate loyalty and promotional data directly in Braze, allowing marketers to personalize customer engagement using real-time data such as point balances, promotions, and reward activities.

#### Eppo - A/B Testing

The Braze and [Eppo]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/eppo/) integration allows you to set up A/B tests in Braze and analyze results in Eppo to uncover insights and tie message performance to long-term business metrics like revenue or retention.

#### Mention Me - Referrals

Together, [Mention Me](https://www.mention-me.com/) and Braze can be your gateway to attracting premium customers and fostering unwavering brand loyalty. By seamlessly integrating first-party referral data into Braze, you can deliver highly-personalized omnichannel experiences targeted at your brand fans. To get started, see [Technology Partners: Mention Me]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/mention_me).

#### Shopify - eCommerce

[Connect multiple Shopify store domains]({{site.baseurl}}/shopify_connecting_multiple_stores/) to a single workspace to have a holistic view of your customers across all markets. Build and launch automation programs and journeys in a single workspace without duplicating efforts across regional stores.

### Other

#### Update to Building accessible messages in Braze

We’ve updated our [Building accessible messages in Braze]({{site.baseurl}}/help/accessibility/) article with clearer, more prescriptive guidance on creating accessible messages. This article now includes expanded best practices for content structure, alt text, buttons, and color contrast, along with a new section on ARIA handling for custom HTML messages. 

This update is part of our broader effort to support more accessible messaging experiences in Braze. We know accessibility is an evolving area, and we’ll keep sharing what we learn.

{% multi_lang_include accessibility/feedback.md %}

### SDK updates

The following SDK updates have been released. Breaking updates are listed below; all other updates can be found by checking the corresponding SDK changelogs.

- [Android SDK 36.0.0](https://pub.dev/packages/braze_plugin/changelog)
    - This release reverts the increase to the minimum Android SDK version of the Braze Android SDK from API 21 to API 25 introduced in 34.0.0. This allows the SDK to once again be compiled into apps supporting as early as API 21. Note that while we are re-introducing the ability to compile, we are not reintroducing formal support for < API 25, and cannot guarantee that the SDK will work as intended on devices running those versions.
    - If your app supports those versions, you should:
        - Validate your integration of the SDK works as intended on physical devices (not just emulators) for those API versions.
        - If you cannot validate expected behavior, you must either call [disableSDK](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-android-sdk/kdoc/braze-android-sdk/com.braze/-braze/-companion/disable-sdk.html), or not initialize the SDK on those versions. Otherwise, you may cause unintended side effects or degraded performance on your end users' devices.
    - Fixed an issue where in-app messages would cause a read on the main thread.
    `BrazeInAppMessageManager.displayInAppMessage` is now a Kotlin suspend function.
        - If you do not call this function directly, you do not need to make any changes.
    - AndroidX Compose BOM updated to 2025.04.01 to handle updates in the Jetpack Compose APIs.
- [React Native SDK 15.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
    - Updates the native Android bridge from Braze Android SDK 35.0.0 to 36.0.0.
    - Updates the native iOS version bindings from Braze Swift SDK 11.9.0 to 12.0.0.
    - Updates the unit representation of PushNotificationEvent.timestamp to milliseconds on iOS.
        - Previously, this value would be represented in seconds on iOS. This will now match the existing Android implementation.
- [Web SDK 5.9.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-web-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- [Flutter SDK 14.0.0 5.9.0](https://pub.dev/packages/braze_plugin/changelog)
    - This release reverts the increase to the minimum Android SDK version of the Braze Android SDK from API 21 to API 25 introduced in 34.0.0. This allows the SDK to once again be compiled into apps supporting as early as API 21. However, we are not reintroducing formal support for < API 25. Read more [here](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#3600).
    - Updates the native Android bridge from Braze Android SDK 35.0.0 to 36.0.0.
    - Updates the native iOS bridge from Braze Swift SDK 11.9.0 to 12.0.0.

#### Identifying and merging users

When [identifying]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_identify/) or [merging users]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_users_merge/), you can now use the `least_recently_updated` parameter in the `prioritization` array to prioritize the least recently updated user.

#### Scheduled user merging

[Scheduled merging]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/user_profiles/duplicate_users/#scheduled-merging) allows you to automate the merging of user profiles on a daily basis using preconfigured rules. Braze will notify the admins of your workspace 24 hours before the scheduled merge occurs, providing a reminder and time to review the configuration.

#### Recipient object

You can now include `braze_id` in the [recipient object]({{site.baseurl}}/api/objects_filters/recipient_object/), which allows you to request or write information in our endpoints.

#### New data centers

Braze has launched two new [data centers]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/data_centers/): US-10 and ID-01. You can sign up for region-specific data centers when setting up your Braze account. 

### Unlocking creativity

[WhatsApp video files]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/whatsapp_campaign/create#outbound-messages) can now be hosted through either a URL or in the Braze media library.

#### WhatsApp list messages

[List messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/message_processing/user_messages#list-messages/) appear as a body message with a list of clickable options. Each list can have multiple sections, and each list can have up to 10 rows.

#### Copy preview link

Use **Copy preview link** in your HTML and drag-and-drop [email messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/drag_and_drop/overview/#step-3-add-your-sending-information), [email templates]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/templates/email_template/#step-5-preview-and-test-your-message), and [Content Blocks]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/content_blocks/) to generate a shareable link that shows how your content will look like for a random user.

#### Push registration diagram

We revamped our push notification documentation in the User Guide and added a new diagram to help visualize [what push registration looks like on a larger scale]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/push/push_registration/#what-does-this-look-like-on-a-broader-scale).

### New Braze partnerships

## April 1, 2025 release

### Updates to Braze navigation

The updated navigation in Braze is designed to help you efficiently access features and content across devices. Note that the option to switch between navigation versions is no longer available. Learn more at our dedicated [Navigating Braze]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/navigation) article.

### Developer Guide detangle

Previously, many platform-level tasks were split across multiple pages, such as integrating the Swift SDK being split across six pages. Additionally, shared features were individually documented for each platform, meaning searching for a topic like “Setting Up Push Notifications” would return 10 different pages.

**Before:**

![The previous Swift documentation located in the Platform Integration Guides section.]({% image_buster /assets/img/before_swift.png %})

Now, platform-level tasks have been merged into single pages and shared SDK features now exist on the same page (with the help of our new SDK-tabbing feature). For example, now there’s  only one page for Integrating the Braze SDK, where you can switch between platforms by selecting a tab at the top of the page. When you do, even the in-page table of contents will update to reflect the currently-selected tab.

**After:**

![The updated Swift documentation located in the Swift tab of the Integrating the SDK article.]({% image_buster /assets/img/after_swift.png %})

![The updated Android documentation located in the Android tab of the Integrating the SDK article.]({% image_buster /assets/img/after_android.png %})

### Contributing to Braze Docs

If you didn’t know, our docs are fully open-source! You can learn how in our [Contributing Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/home). This month, we documented some site functionality, like [forcing sections to auto-expand]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/content_management/sections#forcing-auto-expand) and [rendering API-generated content]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/generating_a_preview#step-2-start-a-local-server).

### Data flexibility

#### Update to Canvas entry properties

Canvas entry properties are now part of [Canvas context variables]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/canvas_entry_properties_event_properties). Each context variable includes a name, data type, and a value that can include Liquid. For more information, refer to the [Context component]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/context).

#### Updates to segmentation filters for phone number filters

Segmentation filters have been updated to reflect changes to two phone number filters:

- [Unformatted Phone Number]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/segmentation_filters#unformatted-phone-number) (formerly **Phone Number**): Segments your users by their unformatted phone number.
- [Phone Number]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/segmentation_filters#phone-number) (formerly **Sending Phone Number**): Segments your users by the E.164 formatted phone number field.

#### Delete custom data

As you build targeted campaigns and segments, you may find that you no longer need a custom event or custom attribute. You can now [delete this custom data]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/custom_data/managing_custom_data#deleting-custom-data) and remove its references from your app.

#### Import users with email addresses and phone numbers

You can now use an email address or phone number to [import users]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/user_data_collection/user_import/#importing-with-email-addresses-and-phone-numbers) and omit an external ID or user alias.

#### Service Provider initiated login troubleshooting

Service Provider (SP) initiated login now has a [troubleshooting section]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/single_sign_on/set_up/#troubleshooting) to help you work through issues with SAML and single-sign on issues.

#### User import troubleshooting

The [User Import troubleshooting section]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/user_data_collection/user_import#troubleshooting) has new and updated entries, including how to troubleshoot missing rows in your imported CSV files.

#### Frequently asked questions for Segment Extensions

Check out our [frequently asked questions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/segment_extension/#frequently-asked-questions) for Segment Extensions, including how you can create a Segment Extension that uses multiple custom events.

#### Personalized and extended delays

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

You can set up a [personalized delay]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/delay_step#personalized-delays) for your users and use this with a Context step to select the context variable to delay by.

You can also now extend Delay steps up to two years. For example, if you’re onboarding new users for your app, you can add an extended delay for two months before sending a Message step to nudge the users who haven’t started a session.

#### Default user profile attributes for Snowflake

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Beta" %}

There are now three [default user profile attributes]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_analytics/data_warehouses/snowflake/user_attributes/) in Snowflake. Each view is designed for a specific use case with its own performance considerations. For example, you can be provided a periodic snapchat of a user profile's default attributes.

### Robust channels

#### Messaging fundamentals

[Messaging Fundamentals]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/messaging_fundamentals) is a new section in Engagement Tools that houses the shared concepts and terms for campaigns and Canvases, such as archiving and localizing messages.

#### WhatsApp custom domains

You can now assign [custom domains]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/whatsapp_campaign/custom_domains/) to one or multiple WhatsApp subscription groups.

#### Triggered in-app messages for Canvas

You can now select a [trigger for your in-app messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/canvas_by_channel/in-app_messages_in_canvas) to be triggered on session start, or by custom events and purchases. After any delays pass and the audience options are checked, in-app messages are set to live when a user reaches the Message step. If a user starts a session and performs the trigger event for the in-app message, the user will see the in-app message. 

#### Limit entrance volume for Canvas

You can limit the number of people who would potentially enter this Canvas by a selected cadence (daily, lifetime of the Canvas, or every time the Canvas is scheduled). For example, you can [set the entry controls]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/create_a_canvas?tab=action-based%20delivery#step-2c-set-your-target-entry-audience) to allow the Canvas to only send to 5,000 users per day.

#### New use case: Booking reminder email system

Learn how you can use Braze features to [build a booking reminder email messaging service]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/ideas_and_strategies/booking_use_case). The service will allow users to book appointments and will message users with reminders of their upcoming appointments. Though this use case uses email messages, you can send messages in any, or multiple, channels based on a single update to a user profile.

#### Click tracking for specific links

You can [turn off click tracking]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/universal_links#turning-off-click-tracking-on-a-link-to-link-basis) for specific links by adding HTML code to your email message in the HTML editor or to components in the drag-and-drop editor.

#### Dynamic Apple Push Notification Service gateway management

[Dynamic APNs gateway management]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/push_notifications/?sdktab=swift#swift_dynamic-apns-gateway-management) enhances the reliability and efficiency of iOS push notifications by automatically detecting the correct APNs environment. Previously, you would manually select APNs environments (development or production) for your push notifications, which sometimes led to incorrect gateway configurations, delivery failures, and BadDeviceToken errors.

#### Flutter support for Banners

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

Banners now support Flutter. Additionally, all Banner documentation has been overhauled for easier usability. Check out the following articles to get started:

- [About Banners]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/banners/)
- [Creating Banner campaigns]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/banners/creating_campaigns/)
- [Embedding Banners into your app]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/banners/creating_placements/)

#### WhatsApp click tracking

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

[Click tracking]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/whatsapp_campaign/click_tracking/) lets you measure when someone taps a link in your WhatsApp message—giving you a clear view into what content is driving engagement. Braze shortens your URLs, adds tracking behind the scenes, and logs click events as they happen.

#### Frequently asked questions for push

Check out our new [Push FAQ]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/push/faq) article that addresses some of the most frequently asked questions that arise when setting up push campaigns.

#### Push troubleshooting

[Push troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/push/troubleshooting) provides a number of steps to help you navigate delivery challenges with push notifications. For example, if you're experiencing delivery challenges with push notifications, we've compiled steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue.

### New Braze partnerships

#### Movable Ink Da Vinci - Dynamic Content

The Braze and Movable Ink [Da Vinci]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/movable_ink_da_vinci) integration empowers brands to deliver highly personalized messaging by leveraging Da Vinci’s AI-driven content decisioning engine. Da Vinci curates the most relevant content for each user and seamlessly deploys messages through Braze.

### SDK updates

The following SDK updates have been released. Breaking updates are listed below; all other updates can be found by checking the corresponding SDK changelogs.

- [Flutter SDK 13.0.0](https://pub.dev/packages/braze_plugin/changelog)
    - Updates the native Android bridge from [Braze Android SDK 33.0.0 to 35.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/compare/v33.0.0...v35.0.0#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed).
        - The minimum required Android SDK version is 25. See more details [here](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#version-information).
- [Swift SDK v11.8.0-11.9.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
- [Web SDK v5.8.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-web-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## March 4, 2025 release

### Deferrals

Braze has updated our definition for what is a soft bounce and is sending a new event called [deferrals]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/reporting_and_analytics/email_reporting/#email-performance) starting February 25, 2025 at 10 am EST.

For Sendgrid customers, we made a change to separate out deferral events from our soft bounce events. We count deferred events as a soft bounce event. This impacts any Sendgrid customer using Currents, Query Builder, SQL Extension, Snowflake Data Sharing, or our Transactional Email product.

#### Prior behavior

Before February 25, 2025, a deferred event for an email address on a campaign or Canvas logs a soft bounce event every time. As a result, deferrals are included as part of soft bounce data. This can result in a user or a campaign reporting more soft bounce events than expected. 

#### New behavior

Starting February 25, 2025, a deferred event will no longer log a soft bounce event every time. Instead, we'll log a soft bounce event once per send for the email address, no matter how many times the email is retried or deferred.

#### What this means

You'll notice a sizable drop in the volume of soft bounce events starting on February 25, 2025, resulting in the following potential changes:

- Decrease in soft bounces for any reports built using Query Builder
- Smaller segment size using SQL Extensions if you’re targeting users that have soft bounced X times over Y period
- Drop in the number of soft bounce events delivered using Currents and any of our features using Snowflake
- Drop in the number of soft bounces for Transactional Email product

For Sparkpost customers, there is no impact on your soft bounce event data, instead you'll start receiving a new email event, deferral, in Currents and Snowflake.

### Developer Guide detangle

Identical content that's shared across multiple SDKs are starting to be merged together using the docs site's new SDK tabbing feature. This month [SDK integration]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/sdk_integration/), [SDK initialization]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/sdk_initialization/), and [Content Cards]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/content_cards/) were combined. Stay tuned for more updates in the coming months.

### Data flexibility
 
#### Braze IDs for user profiles

A user profile now includes a [Braze ID]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/user_profiles#user-profiles). You can use this when searching for user profiles.

#### Deferrals

Braze has updated our definition for what is a soft bounce and is sending a new event called [deferrals]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/reporting_and_analytics/email_reporting#email-performance), which is when an email was not immediately delivered, but Braze will retry the email for up to 72 hours after this temporary delivery failure to maximize the chances of successful delivery before attempts for that specific campaign are stopped.

#### Snowflake entity relationships
 
We've mapped the [raw table schemas](https://www.braze.com/docs/assets/download_file/data-sharing-raw-table-schemas.txt) for Snowflake and Braze entity relationships to a new [user-friendly docs page](https://www.braze.com/docs/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/data_warehouses/snowflake/entity_relationships). It includes a breakdown of the `USER_MESSAGES` tables belonging to each channel, as well as descriptions for each table's primary, foreign, and native keys.

#### Identity management for external IDs

Using an email address or a hashed email address as your Braze external ID can simplify identity management across your data sources; however, it's important to consider the [potential risks]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/user_data_collection/user_profile_lifecycle/#identified-user-profiles) to user privacy and data security.
 
### Unlocking creativity

#### Liquid tutorials

Added three [Liquid tutorials]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/operators/#tutorials) about how to use operators in the following scenarios.

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>Choosing a message with an integer custom attribute.</td>

  </tr>
</table>
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 role="presentation"}

#### Context steps for Canvas
 
{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}
 
Use [Context steps]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/context) to create or update a set of variables that represent the context of a user (or insights into that user’s behavior) as they move through a Canvas.

#### Personalized delay

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

You can set up a [personalized delay]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/delay_step/#personalized-delays) for your users by selecting the **Personalize delay** toggle in your Delay step. You can use this with a Context step to select a context variable to delay by.

When setting up a Delay step in your Canvas user journey, you can now create a delay up to 2 years.

#### Reverting automatic synchronization

When [composing an email message]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/html_editor/creating_an_email_campaign/#step-3-compose-your-email), you can revert to automatic synchronization in the Plaintext tab by selecting the Regenerate from HTML icon, which only appears if the plaintext isn’t synchronizing.

![The revert button for automatic synchronization in Braze.]({% image_buster /assets/img/release_notes/2025_05_04/regenerate_from_html.png %})
 
### Robust channels

#### Android Live Updates

Although Live Updates won’t be officially available until 
[Android 16](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/01/first-beta-android16.html), our [Live Updates for Android]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/push_notifications/live_notifications/?sdktab=android&tab=local) page shows you how to emulate their behavior, so you can display interactive lock-screen notifications similar to [Live Activities for the Swift Braze SDK]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/push_notifications/live_notifications/?sdktab=swift). Unlike official Live Updates, this functionality can be implemented for older Android versions.

#### Copying campaigns with feature flags across workspaces

You can now [copy campaigns with feature flags across workspaces]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/managing_campaigns/copying_to_workspace/#copying-campaigns-with-feature-flags). To do so, make sure the destination workspace has a feature flag experiment configured with an ID that matches the feature flag referenced in the original campaign.

#### New WhatsApp message types supported

WhatsApp messages now support [video, audio, and document outbound messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/whatsapp_campaign/create#outbound-messages). Contact your Braze account manager if you're interested in participating in the early access.

#### Right-to-left messages

[Creating right-to-left messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/messaging_fundamentals/localization/right_to_left_messages/) covers best practices for crafting messages in languages that read right-to-left so that your messages display accurately as much as possible.
 
### AI and ML automation
 
#### Item recommendations

[Using item recommendations in messaging]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/recommendations/using_recommendations) covers the `product_recommendation` Liquid object and includes a tutorial to help you put that knowledge into practice.

### New Braze partnerships
 
#### Email Love - Channel Extensions
 
The Braze and [Email Love]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/) partnership leverages Email Love’s Export to Braze feature and the Braze API to upload your email templates to Braze seamlessly.

#### VWO - A/B Testing
 
The Braze and [VWO]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_analytics/ab_testing/vwo/) integration allows you to leverage VWO experiment data to create targeted segments and deliver personalized campaigns.

### Braze Docs improvements

#### Contributing Guide
Our recent updates to the [Contributing Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/your_first_contribution) makes it easier for non-technical users to contribute to Braze Docs.

#### Data and Analytics revamp
To make it easier for you to find what you're looking for, we separated the articles formerly nested under "Data & Analytics" into [Data]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data) and [Analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics). 

#### Developer Guide
We've done a huge cleanup of all docs across the [Braze Developer Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/home), which included merging "how-to's" split across multiple pages into a single page.

There's also a new [SDK reference page]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/references) that lists all of the reference documentation and repositories for each Braze SDK.

##### Unreal Engine Braze SDK
We migrated and rewrote all content from the Unreal Engine Braze SDK GitHub repository README into its [dedicated section on Braze Docs]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/sdk_integration/?sdktab=unreal%20engine).

### Data flexibility

#### API usage dashboard

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

The [API usage dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/dashboard/api_usage_dashboard) lets you monitor your incoming REST API traffic into Braze to understand your trends within your usage of our REST APIs and to troubleshoot any potential issues.

#### Adding tags to custom attributes

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can [add tags to a custom attribute]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/custom_data/custom_attributes#adding-tags) after it's created if you have the "Manage Events, Attributes, Purchases" permission. The tags can then be used to filter the list of attributes.

#### Catalog selections and async catalog fields endpoints 

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

The following endpoints are now generally available:
* [POST: Create Catalog Fields]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/catalogs/catalog_fields/asynchronous/post_create_catalog_fields)

#### Using a phone number to identify a user via the API

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can now use a phone number, in addition to an alias and email address, to identify a user through the [`/users/identify` API endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_identify)

#### Getting a SAML trace
We added [steps on how to obtain a SAML trace]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/single_sign_on/set_up#obtaining-a-saml-trace), which helps you resolve issues about SAML SSO with Support more efficiently.
 
#### Region-specific data centers
As Braze is growing to serve new areas, we've added an [article about Braze data centers]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/data_centers) to clarify our operational approach.
 
### Unlocking creativity
 
#### Price drop notifications and back-in-stock notifications

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can now notify customers when an item is back-in-stock by setting up [back-in-stock notifications]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/catalog_triggers/back_in_stock_notifications) through a Canvas and catalog.

You can also create [price drop notifications]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/catalog_triggers/price_drop_notifications) to notify customers when an item's price has decreased by setting up price drop notifications in a catalog and Canvas.

#### Preview for selection 

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

After creating a selection, you can [view what a selection would return]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/selections/#test-and-preview) for either a random user or a specific user.

#### Suppression lists

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Beta" %}
 
[Suppression lists]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/suppression_lists) specify groups of users who will never receive messages. Admins can create suppression lists with segment filters to narrow down a user group the same way you would for segmentation.
