# Most Recent Braze Release Notes {#most-recent}

> Braze releases information on product updates on a monthly cadence, aligning with major Product Releases, though the product is updated with miscellaneous improvements week to week.
> <br>
> <br>
> For more information on any of the updates listed in this section, reach out to your account manager or [open a support ticket][support]. You can also check out [our SDK Changelogs]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/sdk_changelogs/) to see more information on our monthly SDK releases, updates, and improvements.

## September 2021

### Google Audience Sync
The Braze [Audience Sync to Google]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/canvas_steps/google_audience_sync/) integration enables brands to extend the reach of their cross-channel customer journeys to Google Search, Google Shopping, Gmail, YouTube, and Google Display. Using your first-party customer data, you can securely deliver ads based upon dynamic behavioral triggers, segmentation, and more. Any criteria you'd typically use to trigger a message (e.g., push, email, SMS, etc.) as part of a Braze Canvas can be used to trigger an ad to that user via Google's Customer Match.

### Best Practice iOS SDK Integration Guide
This optional [iOS integration SDK guide]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/initial_sdk_setup/ios_sdk_integration/) takes you on a step-by-step journey on setup best practices when first integrating the iOS SDK and its core components into your application. This guide will help you build a `BrazeManager.swift` helper file that will decouple any dependencies on the Braze iOS SDK from the rest of your production code, resulting in one `import AppboyUI` in your entire application. This approach limits issues that arise from excessive SDK imports, making it easier to track, debug, and alter code. 

### Predictive Purchases
Predictive Purchases give marketers a powerful tool for identifying and messaging users based on their likelihood to make a purchase. When you create a Purchase Prediction, Braze trains a machine learning model using [gradient boosted decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) to learn from previous purchase activity and predict future purchase activity. Visit our [Predicitve Purchases]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/predictive_suite/predictive_purchases/) doc to learn more. 

### Drag & Drop Editor
With Braze Email, you can create completely custom and personalized email messages in either Campaigns or Canvas using our new Drag & Drop editing experience. Users can now drag editor blocks into their emails, allowing more intuitive customization. To learn how to get started with the Drag & Drop Editor, visit our [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/drag_and_drop/overview/). 

### User Alias Import
To target users who don't have an `external_id`, you can import a list of users with user aliases. An alias serves as an alternative unique user identifier. It can be helpful if you are trying to market to anonymous users who haven't signed up or made an account with your app. Visit our [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/user_data_collection/user_import/#import-with-user-alias) to learn more. 

### iOS 15 Upgrade Guide
This [guide]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/ios_15/) outlines changes introduced in iOS 15 (WWDC21) and the required upgrade steps for your Braze iOS SDK integration.

### Android 12 Upgrade Guide
This [guide]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/android_12/) describes relevant changes introduced in Android 12 (2021) and the required upgrade steps for your Braze Android SDK integration.

### A2P 10DLC
A2P 10DLC refers to a system in the United States that allows businesses to send Application-to-Person (A2P) type messaging via a standard 10-digit long code (10DLC) phone number. 10-digit long codes have traditionally been designed for Person-to-Person (P2P) traffic, causing businesses to be constrained by limited throughput and heightened filtering. This service helps alleviate those issues, improving overall message deliverability, allowing brands to send messages at scale, including links and calls to action, and helping further protect consumers from unwanted messages. 

All customers who currently have and/or use US long codes to send to US customers must register their long codes for 10DLC. To read more about the specifics of 10DLC and why it's required, visit our dedicated [10DLC article]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/phone_numbers/10dlc/).

### Two-Factor Authentication Reset
Users experiencing issues logging in via two-factor authentication can reach out to their company admins to reset their two-factor authentication. Visit our [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/company_settings/security_settings/#user-authetication-reset) to learn more. 

### New Braze Partnerships

Documentation on this can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/export/campaigns/get_campaign_details/#messages).

## July 2021

### Transactional Email Campaigns
Transactional emails are those sent to facilitate an agreed-upon transaction between a sender and the recipient. Braze's Transactional email campaign type is purpose-built for sending automated, non-promotional email messages like order confirmations, password resets, billing alerts, or other business-critical notifications. In addition, a corresponding [transactional email endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/messaging/send_messages/post_send_transactional_message/) has been created. Transactional emails and the new endpoint are only available as part of select Braze packages. Visit our [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/api/api_campaigns/transactional_campaigns) to learn more. 

### Nested Object Support for Event Properties
Braze now supports [nested objects]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/nested_object_support/) for custom events and purchase events. Nested objects allow you to send arrays of data as properties of custom events and purchases. This nested data can be used for templating personalized information in API-triggered messages through the use of Liquid and dot notation.

### New HMAC Liquid Encoding Filters
