# Most recent Braze release notes {#most-recent}

> Braze releases information on product updates on a monthly cadence, aligning with major Product Releases, though the product is updated with miscellaneous improvements week to week.
> <br>
> <br>
> For more information on any of the updates listed in this section, reach out to your account manager or [open a support ticket][support]. You can also check out [our SDK Changelogs]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/sdk_changelogs/) to see more information on our monthly SDK releases, updates, and improvements.

## May 2, 2023 release

### Redesigned Braze UI/UX

_Generally available on May 16, 2023_

Save time and find exactly what you need with the newly redesigned UI/UX and information architecture. Quickly navigate throughout the platform, complete tasks, and discover new features with ease. To make this transition easier for you and your team, check out our dedicated [navigation guide]({{site.baseurl}}/navigation) to learn what has changed and what you can expect next.

### Query builder

With the [query builder]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/query_builder), you can generate reports using Braze data in Snowflake. The query builder comes with pre-built SQL query templates to get you started, or you can write your own custom SQL queries to unlock even more insights.

### Canvas version history

[Version history]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/managing_canvases/canvas_version_history/) allows you to view and access Canvas analytics and the user journeys for any previous version of your Canvas. Referencing your Canvas version history can be especially helpful to maintain a record of the evolution of a Canvas.

### Incremental refresh for SQL Segments

You can now create [SQL Segment Extensions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/sql_segments/) that use incremental refresh, which only refreshes the last 2 days worth of data. This is more cost-efficient and uses up fewer SQL Segment credits each time the segment membership refreshes. Unlike full refresh extensions, you can set incremental refresh extensions to automatically regenerate membership daily.

### Deliverability Center for email

The [Deliverability Center]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/analytics/deliverability_center#deliverability-center) provides more insight into your email performance by supporting the use of Gmail Postmaster Tools to track data on emails sent and gather data about your sending domain.

{% alert important %}
The Deliverability Center is currently in early access. Contact your Braze customer success manager if you’re interested in participating in the early access.
{% endalert %}

### Update for catalog limitations

As of May 1, 2023, there have been updates for [catalogs storage limits]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/catalog/#limits). To request an upgrade for catalogs storage, contact your Braze account manager.

### New API and SDK endpoints article

Braze manages a number of different instances for our dashboard, SDK, and REST endpoints, which we call "clusters." Check out [API and SDK endpoints]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/sdk_endpoints) for a list of dashboard URLs, API endpoints, and SDK endpoints for available Braze instances.

### Liquid FAQ

We’ve answered some [frequently asked questions for Liquid]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/faq/). 

### iOS SDK deprecation - Swift

Braze's legacy iOS SDK is being deprecated in favor of the new Swift SDK. This brings improved performance, new features, and many improvements—including [new documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/initial_sdk_setup/overview)!

Looking to upgrade? Check out our [migration guide](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/braze/appboy-migration-guide/) for details.

![A series of breadcrumbs navigating from User Guide > Message Building by Channel > In-App Messages > Templates > Simple Survey][1]{: style="max-width:55%"}

### Creating catalogs in browser
You can use catalogs to reference non-user data in your Braze campaigns through Liquid. Braze now allows you to create a catalog directly in your browser instead of importing a CSV. Refer to [Creating a catalog]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/catalog) for more for more information.

### Custom SQL in query builder
With the query builder, you can generate reports using Braze data in Snowflake. Now, you can [use custom SQL]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/query_builder/custom_sql) to unlock new insights.

{% alert important %}
The SQL editor is in early access. If you're interested in participating in the early access, reach out to your customer success manager.
{% endalert %}

### Feature flag FAQ
We've answered some [frequently asked questions for feature flags]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_wide/feature_flags/faq).

### Message extras Liquid tag for Currents
Using the [`message_extras` Liquid tag]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/advanced_filters/message_extras), you can annotate your send events with dynamic data from Connected Content, custom attributes (such as language, country), and Canvas entry properties. This Liquid tag appends key-value pairs to the corresponding send event in Currents.

{% alert important %}
This Liquid tag is currently in beta for email, SMS, and push send events. Contact your Braze customer success manager if you're interested in participating in the beta.
{% endalert %}

### New Currents events: users_campaigns_abort and users_canvas_abort
Two new events were added to the Currents glossary: [Canvas abort message events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events#canvas-abort-message-events) and [campaign abort message events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events#campaign-abort-message-events).

### New API endpoints: Catalogs
Use the [Update catalog item]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/catalogs/catalog_items/synchronous/put_update_catalog_item/) and [Update catalog items]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/catalogs/catalog_items/asynchronous/put_update_catalog_items/) endpoints to update an item or multiple items in your catalog.

### Shopify Historical Backfill
[Shopify Historical Backfill](https://www.braze.com/docs/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/ecommerce/shopify/shopify_backfill/) allows Braze to import all customers, orders, and purchase events from the last 90 days prior to your Shopify integration connection.

### WhatsApp
WhatsApp is a popular peer-to-peer messaging platform used across the world offering conversation-based messaging for businesses. The [WhatsApp messaging channel]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp) offers a direct way to engage users on the WhatsApp platform through campaigns, opt-ins and opt-outs, quick replies, and more.

#### WhatsApp API object
As part of Braze's WhatsApp support, the `whats_app` object allows you to modify or create WhatsApp messages via our [messaging endpoints]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/messaging). See the [`whats_app` object documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/api/objects_filters/messaging/whats_app_object) for the full spec.

### New Braze partnerships

#### Merkury - Analytics
The Braze and [Merkury]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/analytics/merkury) integration allows you to leverage the `MerkuryID` to increase site visitor recognition rates for Braze customers.

### SDK updates

- [Web SDK v4.7.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-web-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## March 7, 2023 release

### Removing support for duplicating original experience Canvases

As of February 28, 2023, you can no longer create or duplicate Canvases using the original Canvas experience. Braze recommends that customers who use the original Canvas experience move to Canvas Flow. It’s an improved editing experience to better build and manage Canvases. Learn more about [cloning your Canvases to Canvas Flow]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/managing_canvases/cloning_canvases/).

### Live Activities for iOS (early access)

[Live Activities]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/live_activities/live_activities/) are persistent, interactive notifications displayed on your lock screen, allowing you to keep an eye on things in real-time. Because they appear on the lock screen, Live Activities ensure that your notifications won’t be missed. Because they’re persistent, you can display up-to-date content to your users without even having them unlock their phone.

{% alert important %}
Live Activities are currently in early access. Contact your Braze account manager if you’re interested in participating.
{% endalert %}

### Card creation for Content Cards

You can now choose when Braze evaluates audience eligibility and personalization for new Content Card campaigns by specifying when the card is created.

The following options are available:

- **At campaign launch:** The previous default behavior for Content Cards. Braze calculates audience eligibility and personalization when the campaign launches, then creates the card and stores it until the user opens your app.
- **At first impression:** When the user next opens your app (that is, starts a new session), Braze determines which Content Cards the user is eligible for, templates any personalization like Liquid or Connected Content, then creates the card.

For more information, refer to [card creation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/create/card_creation/).

### Reset styles for in-app message Drag & Drop Editor

In the Drag & Drop Editor for in-app messages, you can now quickly reset styles to their default styling after making changes. For more, refer to [resetting styles to default]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/drag_and_drop/create/#resetting-styles-to-default).

### Custom domains for link shortening

Link shortening also allows you to use your own domain to personalize the look and feel of your shortened URLs, helping portray a consistent brand image. Once configured, [custom domains]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/campaign/link_shortening/#custom-domains) can be assigned to one or multiple SMS subscription groups.

### Safari mobile web push

Safari v16.4 supports mobile web push, which means you can now re-engage mobile users with push notifications on iOS and iPadOS. Follow our dedicated guide for steps on how to support [web push on Safari for iOS and iPadOS]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/push_notifications/safari_mobile_push/).

### User Update component use cases

The User Update component in Canvas allows you to update a user’s attributes, events, and purchases in a JSON composer—but are you not quite sure how to make the most of this feature? We've added [three example use cases]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/user_update/#use-cases) to give you some ideas.

### User lookup

This new article describes how to use [user lookup]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/user_lookup) to search for a specific user directly from the composer to test if your filters and segments are set up correctly. This can also be helpful when troubleshooting a campaign or Canvas that isn’t sending as expected—for example, if users aren’t receiving a message when they should be.

User lookup is available when:

- Creating a segment
- Setting up a campaign or Canvas audience
- Setting up an Audience Paths step

### Blocklisting or deleting custom data

This new article describes how to retire a custom data object by [blocklisting or deleting custom data]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/blocklist_delete_custom_data/).

You may occasionally identify custom attributes, custom events, or purchase events that are either consuming too many data points, are no longer useful to your marketing strategy, or were recorded in error. To stop this data from being sent to Braze, you can blocklist a custom data object while your engineering team works to remove it from the backend of your app or website.

### New Braze partnerships

#### Sisu Data - Business intelligence

The [Sisu Data]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/business_intelligence/sisu_data/) and Braze integration allows you to understand across all campaigns or at a campaign level why metrics (e.g., open rate, click-through rate, conversion rate, etc.) are changing and what drives the most optimal outcomes. Once these segments are identified, Braze users can materialize the outputs in their data warehouse or send them directly from Sisu to Braze to retarget and reengage users.

#### Loplat - Contextual location

The Braze and [loplat]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_personalization/location/loplat/) integration allows you to use loplat’s location services (store POI and custom geofence) to trigger geo-contextual marketing campaigns and create custom events using offline segmentation. When users visit the targeted location you set in loplat X, the campaign and location information are sent immediately to Braze.

#### ActionIQ - Customer data platform

The Braze and [ActionIQ]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/customer_data_platform/actioniq/) integration allows brands to sync and map their ActionIQ data directly to Braze, empowering the delivery of extraordinary customer experiences based on the entire breadth of their customer data. The integration enables the users to:

- Map audience segments or custom attributes to Braze directly from ActionIQ
- Forward the events tracked by ActionIQ to Braze in real time to trigger personalized and targeted campaigns

#### Komo - Dynamic content

The Braze and [Komo]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_personalization/dynamic_content/komo/) integration allows you to gather first and zero-party data through Komo Engagement Hubs. These hubs are dynamic microsites that offer interactive content and gamification features. The user data collected from these hubs are then transmitted to the Braze API.

- Ingest first and zero-party user data gather from Komo to Braze in real-time
- Ingest market research and user preference data when they answer surveys, polls, and quiz questions
- Progressively build user profiles in Braze over time as the user continues to engage and share more data about themselves
- Standardize the look and feel of transactional emails sent through Braze

#### Phrase - Localization

The [Phrase]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_personalization/localization/phrase/) and Braze integration allow you to translate email templates and content blocks without leaving the Braze interface. With the Phrase TMS integration for Braze, you can increase customer engagement and drive growth into new markets with seamless localization.

#### Nift - Loyalty

The Braze and [Nift]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/loyalty/nift/) integration allows you to automatically trigger “thank-yous” containing Nift gifts at key moments in the customer lifecycle and identify which customers used their gift. Nift gift cards can be used to access products and services supplied by brands relying on Nift’s matchmaking technology to acquire new customers cost-effectively at scale.

#### Sageflo - Message templates

The Braze and [Sageflo]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/email_templates/sageflo/) integration empowers local teams to easily send their own emails using marketing-approved templates, images, and audience segments through API integrations with Braze.

#### Airbyte - Workflow automation

The Braze and [Airbyte]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/workflow_automation/airbyte/) integration allows users to create a data pipeline to collect and analyze Braze data by connecting all of your applications and databases to a central warehouse. Once data has been collected in the central warehouse, data teams can explore Braze data effectively using their preferred business intelligence tools.

#### Flywheel - Workflow automation

The Braze and [Flywheel]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/workflow_automation/flywheel/) integration allows you to segment customer data directly from data warehouse and send it to Braze–ensuring that users can optimize the deep feature set of Braze in tandem with their single source of truth. Streamline marketing efforts for customer segmentation and activation, reducing the time it takes to segment, launch, test, and measure the results of targeted campaigns sent to Braze.

#### Mozart Data - Workflow automation

The Braze and [Mozart Data]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/workflow_automation/mozart_data/) integration allows you to:

- Use Fivetran to import Braze data into Snowflake
- Create transforms by combining Braze data with other applications data and effectively analyze user behaviors
- Import data from Snowflake into Braze to create new customer engagement opportunities
- Combine Braze data with other applications data to gain a more holistic understanding of user behaviors
- Integrate with a business intelligence tool to further explore the data that is stored in Snowflake

## February 7, 2023 release

### Building accessible messages

Marketing content that excludes people with disabilities, even unintentionally, can prevent millions of people from interacting with your brand. Accessibility in marketing is about making it easy for everyone to experience your marketing, receive and understand your communication, and have the opportunity to invest in or become a fan of your product, service, or brand. Refer to [Building accessible messages in Braze]({{site.baseurl}}/help/accessibility#building-accessible-messages-in-braze) for guidance.

### Query builder early access

With the [query builder]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/query_builder#query-builder
), you can generate reports using Braze data in Snowflake. The query builder comes with pre-built SQL query templates to get you started. Currently only the templated queries are allowed. Support for custom SQL queries will follow.

This feature is currently in early access. If you're interested in participating in the early access, reach out to your customer success manager.

### Feature flags beta

[Feature flags]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_wide/feature_flags) allow you to remotely enable or disable functionality for a selection of users. They let you turn a feature on and off in production without additional code deployment or app store updates. This allows you to safely roll out new features with confidence.

This feature is currently in beta. If you're interested in participating in the beta, reach out to your customer success manager.

### New Currents events

The following Currents events have recently been released and added to the [message engagement event]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events) and [customer behavior and user event]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/event_glossary/customer_behavior_events) glossaries:

Message abort events:
- `users.messages.contentcard.abort`
- `users.messages.email.abort`
- `users.messages.inappmessage.abort`
- `users.messages.newsfeedcard.abort`
- `users.messages.pushnotification.abort`

Canvas exit events:
- `users.canvas.exit.PerformedEvent`
- `users.canvas.exit.MatchedAudience`

### Personalized variant

When sending an A/B test, you can send users a personalized variant, sending them the variant they are most likely to engage with. Refer to [Multivariate analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/testing/multivariant_testing/multivariate_analytics/#personalized-variant) for more on how personalized variants are selected and how to leverage them in your campaigns. 

### SQL Segment Extensions early access

[Segment Extensions]({{site.baseurl}}/sql_segments/) allow you to generate a Segment Extension using Snowflake SQL queries of Snowflake data. SQL can help you unlock new segment use cases because it offers the flexibility to describe the relationships between data in ways that aren't achievable through other segmentation features.

### Pre and post-launch checklist for Canvas

Before and after you launch a Canvas, there are several details you should check:
- Ensure that your messaging and send times align with your audience's preferences
- Account for variations in time zones, entry settings, and more
- Review and adjust your Canvas in the event of discrepancies after launch based on these scenarios

Use this [checklist]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/ideas_and_strategies/pre_post_launch_checklist#pre-and-post-launch-checklist) as a guide to finetune these areas based on your use case to help contribute to the success of your Canvas.

## January 10, 2023 release

### User Update component for Canvas Flow

The [User Update]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/user_update/) component allows you to update a user's attributes, events, and purchases in a JSON composer, so there's no need to include sensitive information like API keys.

### Setting subscription groups via API

When creating new users via the [`/users/track` endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track/), you can set subscription groups within the user attributes object, which allows you to create a user and set the subscription group state in one API call.

### Conversions dashboard early access

The [conversions dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/analytics/conversions_dashboard/) allows you to analyze conversions across campaigns, Canvases, and channels, using different attribution methods. You can specifically track these attribution methods:

- **Open conversions:** Conversions that occurred after a user opened the message
- **Click conversions:** Conversions that occurred after a user clicked the message
- **Received conversions:** Conversions that occurred after a user received the message
- **Last-click conversions:** Conversions that occurred after a user clicked the message if the message was the most recent one the user clicked (This feature is currently being tested on a small subset of early access customers)

This feature is currently in early access. If you're interested in participating in the early access, reach out to your customer success manager.

### Canvas exit events for Braze Currents

You can now track when your users exit a Canvas by either performing an event or by matching an audience.

## December 13, 2022 release

### News Feed is deprecated
News Feed is being deprecated. Braze recommends that customers who use our News Feed tool move over to our Content Cards messaging channel—it's more flexible, customizable, and reliable. Check out the [migration guide]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/migrating_from_news_feed/) for more.

### New API endpoints: Catalogs
Use the [Braze API Catalogs endpoints]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/catalogs) to add, edit, and manage your [catalogs]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs) and catalog item details. You can use the asynchronous catalog endpoints to make bulk changes to your catalog.

### HTML attributes for links in the Drag & Drop Editor for Email
You can now [add HTML attributes]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/drag_and_drop/overview/#creative-details/) to any URL within the `Image`, `Button`, or `Text` editor blocks in the Drag & Drop Editor for Email. With custom attributes, you can easily append additional information to HTML tags in emails. This can be especially useful for message personalization, segmentation, and styling.

### Show Heatmap toggle
You can now use the [Show Heatmap toggle]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/reporting_and_analytics/email_reporting#heatmaps) to bring up a visual view of your **Message Analytics** that shows the overall frequency and location of clicks within the lifespan of the email campaign. You can also download a copy of your heatmaps for future reference.

### Updated email settings
The previous **General Email Settings** section has been split into two new sections: **Sending Configuration** and **Subscription Pages and Footers.** For more information about the individual settings, check out [Email settings]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_app_group/email_settings/#sending-configuration).

### Generate AI images for your Media Library

Read more about [Generating an image using AI]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/media_library/#generate-ai).

### Enhancements to nested custom attributes
You can use nested custom attributes to send objects as a new data type for custom attributes.
- You can [trigger when a nested custom attribute object changes]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/nested_custom_attribute_support/#trigger-nested-custom-attribute-changes).
- You can also now [personalize your messages using a custom attribute object and Liquid]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/nested_custom_attribute_support/#personalization).

### New Video block
A new content block for [Video]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/drag_and_drop/dnd_editor_blocks/#video) has been added to the Drag & Drop Editor for Email.

### Optional Identifier for Vendor collection - Swift
In previous versions of the Braze iOS Swift SDK, the IDFV (Identifier for Vendor) field was automatically collected as the user's device ID. Beginning in Swift SDK v5.7.0, the IDFV field can optionally be disabled, and instead, Braze will set a random UUID as the device ID. For more information, refer to [Collecting IDFV]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/analytics/swift_idfv/).

### Snowflake Reader Accounts
Snowflake Reader Accounts offer users access to the same data and functionality as [Snowflake Data Sharing]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/snowflake/), all without requiring a Snowflake account or customer relationship with Snowflake. With Reader Accounts, Braze will create and share your data into an account and provide you credentials to log in and access your data. This will result in all data sharing and usage billing being handled entirely by Braze.

To learn more, reach out to your customer success manager.

- **Recommendations blocks**: Set algorithms and filtering to source users' personalized content that propagates when the email is opened.
