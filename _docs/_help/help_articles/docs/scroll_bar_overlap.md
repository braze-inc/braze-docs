# Scroll bar overlap

Are you using a Mac and find that your scroll bars are overlapping content within Braze Docs like in the following example?

![Example of scroll bar overlap][1]

Check if your scroll bar overlaps the following code block:

```
<your-bucket-prefix>/dataexport.<cluster-identifier>.S3.integration.<integration-id>/event_type=<event-type>/date=<date>/<schema-id>/<zone>/dataexport.<cluster-identifier>.S3.integration.<integration-id>+<partition>+<offset>.avro
```

If your scroll bar overlaps the code block, we suggest changing the **Show scroll bars:** setting to **Always** in your **General Settings**. This will expand features in Docs (like code blocks) to always show the scroll bar and prevent illegibility.

Here's what your updated scroll bar should look like now:

Insert this where there is a single line of long code that might cause issues:
_Can't see the code because of the scroll bar? See how to fix that [here]({{site.baseurl}}/help/help_articles/docs/scroll_bar_overlap/)._
