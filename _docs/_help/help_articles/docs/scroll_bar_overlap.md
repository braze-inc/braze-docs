# Scroll Bar Overlap

Are you using a Mac and find that your scroll bars are overlapping content within Braze Docs?

It would look something like this:

![Scroll Bar Overlap][1]

Even through you want to be able to see the content - like this:

![Scroll Fixed][3]

Check if your scroll bar overlaps the code block below!

```
<your-bucket-prefix>/dataexport.<cluster-identifier>.S3.integration.<integration-id>/event_type=<event-type>/date=<date>/<schema-id>/<zone>/dataexport.<cluster-identifier>.S3.integration.<integration-id>+<partition>+<offset>.avro
```

If your scroll bar overlaps the code block, we suggest changing the `Show scroll bars:` setting to "Always" in your General Settings. This will expand features in Docs (like code blocks) to always show the scroll bar and prevent illegibility.

![General Settings][2]

It might help you on other sites, too!

Insert this where there is a single line of long code that might cause issues:
_Can't see the code because of the scroll bar? See how to fix that [here]({{site.baseurl}}/help/help_articles/docs/scroll_bar_overlap/)._
