# How Can I Contribute to Braze Docs?

Good news! Braze Docs is now Open Source on Github!

You, too, can contribute to our documentation. If you have a unique perspective as a Braze customer or as a developer integrating Braze, we would love to see your input!

You can find the Braze Docs repo [here](https://github.com/Appboy/braze-docs/) or click the  <i class="fab fa-github"></i> __Edit this page on Github__ button at the bottom of most pages.
