# Contributing to Braze docs

Do you see a typo? Are you not content with waiting to see changes made to Docs? Are you a developer looking to be very active on GitHub?

Good news! Braze documentation is open source on GitHub!

You, too, can contribute to our documentation. If you have a unique perspective as a Braze customer or as a developer integrating Braze, we would love your input!

To get started, go to the [Braze Docs repo](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-docs/wiki) or click the  <i class="fab fa-github"></i> __Edit this page on Github__ button at the bottom of most pages.

{% alert important %}
Before making changes to Braze documentation, you will be asked to sign our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)]({{site.baseurl}}/cla).
{% endalert %}
