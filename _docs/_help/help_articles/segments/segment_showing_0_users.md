# Segment Is Showing No Users

There are two possible solutions when you are seeing ```0``` users, but you anticipated more:
* [Calculate Exact Statistics](#calculate-exact-statistics)
* [Verify Data Transfer](#verify-data-transfer)

## Calculate Exact Statistics

The Segment statistics could be providing an estimate. The estimation is calculated based on a random sample with a 95% confidence interval that the result is within ```+/- 1%```. The smaller your user base is, the more likely it is that the size of your segment is a rough estimate. Click on “Calculate Exact Statistics” on the Segment page. This will calculate the *exact* number of users in your segment.

## Verify Data Transfer

It is possible that the data you are filtering on is not being sent to Braze. To check which custom events are being sent to Braze, click **Custom Events** on the left hand menu in the **Data** section. Select the custom event along with the specific dates and App to see what data is actually being transferred to Braze. If you notice that ```0``` data is being sent to Braze, the next step is to evaluate how you are sending the events to Braze.

{% alert important %} 
The data that you see in the Braze dashboard might not have the identical syntax as what you are sending to Braze. Ensure that these two match exactly.
