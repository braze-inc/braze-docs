# Over-segmentation

Don't over-segment your tracking! Being more generic will help you target more users and draw more useful divisions between user segments.

For example, rather than capturing a separate event for watching each of 50 different movies, it would be more effective to capture simply watching a movie as an event.

If you over segment your user data, your findings will lose statistical significance and wonâ€™t guide the development of your app and marketing initiatives as effectively. When evaluating user-trend data, you can get too involved in the details of a problem to look at the situation as a whole.

Events should be tied directly to your marketing and conversion goals.

{% alert tip %}
Multiple user actions within an app can be labeled with the same custom event or attribute designation. This is useful when you want to track something generically such as "played a song" rather than recording each individual song within a music app as a separate and distinct event.
{% endalert %}
