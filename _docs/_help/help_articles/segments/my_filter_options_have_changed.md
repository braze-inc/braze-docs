# Filter options changed

Your filter options are related to the format (data type) that youâ€™re passing to Braze for your custom attribute. To review the data type that Braze is recognizing for your custom attributes, navigate to **Manage Settings** then select the **Custom Attributes** tab.

If your filter options have changed, this is an indication that your data is being passed to Braze in a different format (data type) than before. For detailed descriptions of different data types and their filtering options, refer to [custom attribute data types][36].

Keep in mind that changing the data type of a custom attribute in the dashboard will reject data that is sent to Braze in a different format.
