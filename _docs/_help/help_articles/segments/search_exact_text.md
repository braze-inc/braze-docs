# Search exact text

You may find that searching for a specific item can sometimes return too many results, as Braze will return all results that have your search term in it.

To search for exact text, wrap your search in square brackets `[ ]`.

For example, if you search for `[Purchase]` on the **Segments** page, you'll see any segments that have the word "purchase" in it, but not "purchasers" or "purchases".
