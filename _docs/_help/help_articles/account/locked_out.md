# Locked Out of Braze Account	

So you're locked out of your Braze Account - no worries! We can help you get back.	

You can tell what kind of lock out you're experiencing by the error message you receive.	

- [I see an error about my password.](#password-error)	
- [I don't see an error, but it still won't let me in.](#instance-error)	
- [I see an error about account suspension.](#account-suspension)	

## Password Error	
Your account's security is important to us - so passwords are required to log into your Braze account.	

- Check that you are logging into the incorrect dashboard [instance][1] (check with your account administrator or Braze Account Manager to be sure).	
- Your password may have expired and [you'll need to reset it][2].	
- If you use a [Single Sign-On][3] service, you should check with your account administrator that the set up has been completed properly.	
- If your company is on several instances of Braze, you may be using the incorrect email to log in.  	

When in doubt, you can always [reset your password][2].	

## Instance Error	

If you are using the same machine you usually do to log in, Braze should automatically detect the correct instance. However, in the event that it doesn't or you're logging in for the first time, we recommend that you consider the following:	

- Check that you are logging into the incorrect dashboard [instance][1] (check with your account administrator or Braze Account Manager to be sure).	
- If your company is on several instances of Braze, you may be using the incorrect email to log in.	


## Account Suspension	

This doesn't happen very often; we take account suspension and deletions very seriously. If you find this error, you best bet is to reach out to your company's Braze administrator, Braze Account Manager, or Braze's [Support][support].
