# Defining push enablement

When you first set up your push notifications, it's important to understand how and which users will receive your messages.

Push enabled refers to users who have a push token available. For example, this may be an active push token for an app within a workspace.

Background push enabled refers to users that are push enabled but have disabled foreground push notifications. In this case, Braze cannot display user-visible notifications on that device. However, you can use background push for tracking uninstalls, enabling silent push notifications, and geofencing.  

For more information, check out our article on [About push notifications]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/push/about).
