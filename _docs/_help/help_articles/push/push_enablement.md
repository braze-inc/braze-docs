# Defining push enablement

When you first set up your push notifications, it's important to understand how and which users will receive your messages.

Push enabled refers to users who have a push token available. For example, this may be an active push token for an app within an app group.

Background push enabled refers to users that are push enabled but have disabled foreground push notifications. In this case, Braze cannot display user-visible notifications on that device. However, you can use background push for tracking uninstalls, enabling silent push notifications, and geofencing.  

For more information, check out our article on [About push notifications][1].
