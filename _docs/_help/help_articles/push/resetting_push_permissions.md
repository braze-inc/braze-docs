2. Under **Notifications**, click **Reset permission**.
3. Open Chrome DevTools. The following are the relevant shortcuts per operating system.

}
</style>

| OS      | Keyboard shortcuts                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mac      | `Fn` + `F12`<br>`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` |
