# December 2016

## Email headers

Email headers add the explicit setting of email headers through the send endpoint. Refer to [Email best practices]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/best_practices/) for more information about sending email with Braze.

## Canvas updates

With this update, you can make one step connect to multiple steps, or have multiple steps connect into a single, merged step, as well as draw connection points between them. For example, users who have made a purchase may follow a different flow from users who have not. For more information about Canvas, refer to [Creating a branch]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/branching/#branching).
