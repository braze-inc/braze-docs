# December 2016

## Email Headers

Email headers add the explicit setting of email headers through the send endpoint. For more information about sending email with Braze, visit the best practices section [here][14].

## Canvas Updates

With this update, you can make one step connect to multiple steps, or have multiple steps connect into a single, merged step, as well as draw connection points between them. For example, users who have made a purchase may follow a different flow from users who have not. For more information about Canvas, visit the Canvas section under dashboard features [here][15].
