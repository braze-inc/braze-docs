# June 2016

## Action Based Trigger for Performing an Exception Event

“Exception events” are used to create powerful logic within action-based campaigns. They are used to remove end users from receiving a message; for example, “send users who abandon their shopping carts a push notification, unless they checkout.” By triggering off of an exception event, customers can direct additional messages and attention to the users who did checkout after abandoning their carts, creating a seamless and cohesive experience.

## "Received Message from Campaign with Tag" Segment Filter

Customers can now exclude users who have received groups of campaigns by the same "Tag" functionality they have already been using.

## Pause & Resume Multiple Campaigns Simultaneously

Customers can now pause and resume multiple campaigns simultaneously from the campaigns page.

## Uninstall Data API Endpoint

Customers can now fetch uninstall tracking data from our export APIs directly. Please see our [Export API Documentation][4] for additional details.

## Improved Error Log

We've improved your ability to sort by error type in the [Message Error Log][5]!
