# November 2016

## Connected audiences

Connected Audiences allows you to target messages to ad hoc subsets of your user base on the fly, without any pre-configuration in Braze. For example, a media app can use custom attribute arrays to track every category or TV show that a customer has favorited. Using Connected Audiences, you can connect a custom CMS with Braze and automatically send a push notification or email to anyone who has favorited a show whenever a new episode is released.
