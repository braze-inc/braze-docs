## iOS 10 Rich Notifications
You can now send rich notifications to customers with iOS 10. Additionally, we have [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/push_notifications/integration/#ios-10-rich-notifications) on how to set up your app to support iOS 10 rich notifications.

## Upgrade App Added as Conversion Event

Tracking app upgrades as campaign conversion event allows you to easily track how their messaging efforts are meeting their goals.
