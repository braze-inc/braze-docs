# January 10, 2023 release

## User Update component for Canvas Flow

The [User Update]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/user_update/) component allows you to update a user’s attributes, events, and purchases in a JSON composer, so there’s no need to include sensitive information like API keys. 

## Setting subscription groups via API

When creating new users via the [/users/track]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track/) endpoint, you can set subscription groups within the user attributes object, which allows you to create a user and set the subscription group state in one API call.

## Conversions dashboard early access

The [conversions dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/your_analytics_dashboards/conversions_dashboard/) allows you to analyze conversions across campaigns, Canvases, and channels, using different attribution methods. You can specifically track these attribution methods:

- **Open conversions:** Conversions that occurred after a user opened the message
- **Click conversions:** Conversions that occurred after a user clicked the message
- **Received conversions:** Conversions that occurred after a user receved the message
- **Last-click conversions:** Conversions that occurred after a user clicked the message if the message was the most recent one the user clicked (This feature is currently being tested on a small subset of early access customers)

This feature is currently in early access. If you’re interested in participating in the early access, reach out to your customer success manager.

## Canvas exit events for Braze Currents

You can now track when your users exit a Canvas by either performing an event or by matching an audience. Check out the [Message Engagement Events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events/) section in the Currents Event Glossary for more information.
