# July 25, 2023 release

## Canvas approval 
The new Canvas approval workflow setting adds a review process prior to launching a new Canvas. Note that this feature is turned off by default, giving you control over its implementation. Explore more details about activating this workflow in [Canvas approvals and permissions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/managing_canvases/canvas_approval/).
 
## Feature flags in Canvas
Feature flags allow you to experiment and confirm your hypotheses around new features by turning them off and on for different sections of your user base. The new feature flag component in Canvas allows you to segment your audience in a Canvas based on whether a feature flag is on or off for a user. Moreover, Experiment Paths allow you optimize these conversions by testing different messages or paths against each other and determining which is most effective. See the [feature flag overview]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_wide/feature_flags/about/) for information about feature flags generally, or learn more about [using feature flags in Canvas]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/feature_flags/).

## Managing Segments article
The new [Managing Segments]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/managing_segments/) article covers the actions you can take to configure your segments, such as filtering a list of segments, creating segments, and editing segments.
 
## Row component Content Block
You can now save a row component as a Content Block that can then be used in all email campaigns and email messages in a Canvas. For more information on drag-and-drop Content Blocks, refer to [Content Blocks]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/drag_and_drop/dnd_content_blocks/).
