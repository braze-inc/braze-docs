# September 19, 2023 release

## BigQuery for Cloud Data Ingestion

You can now create Cloud Data Ingestion integrations with [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery), a serverless enterprise data warehouse. For more information, refer to [Cloud Data Integestion integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/cloud_ingestion/integrations/?tab=bigquery).

## Braze Data Transformation

[Braze Data Transformation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/data_transformation/overview/) allows you to build and manage webhook integrations to automate data flow from external platforms into Braze user profiles. This newly integrated user data can then power even more sophisticated marketing use cases.

## Commenting in Canvas

[Comments in Canvases]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/canvas_comments/) can be a great collaborative space for your marketing team to identify, discuss, and review the finer details of your Canvases. As you build out a Canvas, you can make and manage comments to identify these areas that may require additional feedback from your colleagues.

## Deliverability Center

The [Deliverability Center]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/dashboard/deliverability_center/) provides more insight into your email performance by supporting the use of Gmail Postmaster Tools to track data on emails sent and gather data about your sending domain. 

Email deliverability is the core of campaign success. Using the Deliverability Center in the Braze dashboard, you can view your domains by IP reputation or delivery errors to discover and troubleshoot any potential issues with email deliverability.

## Drag-and-drop editor for in-app messages

These additional features have been added to the [drag-and-drop editor for in-app messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/drag_and_drop/create/):

- Text links that do not dismiss the message
- Button action to request push primer
- Custom code editor block

To take advantage of all features available in the drag-and-drop editor, update your SDKs to the recommended SDK versions.

### Save custom templates (early access)

In the drag-and-drop editor for in-app messages, early access participants can create and save custom in-app message templates using the **Save as template** button, available after you exit the editor. Before you can save it as a template, you must first launch the campaign OR save it as a draft. 

You can also create and save in-app message templates by navigating to **Templates** > **In-App Message Templates**.

{% alert important %}
The ability to save custom templates is currently in early access. Contact your Braze account manager if you're interested in participating in the early access.
{% endalert %}

## Disabling dark mode for in-app messages

Developers can prevent in-app messages from adopting dark mode styling when the user device has dark mode turned on. For steps on how to implement this, refer to the following documentation by platform:

- [Swift]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/in-app_messaging/customization/setting_delegates/#disabling-dark-mode)
- [Objective-C]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/in-app_messaging/customization/handling_in_app_display/#disabling-dark-mode)

## New fields for message archiving

[Message archiving]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/export_braze_data/message_archiving/) lets you save a copy of messages sent to users for archival or compliance purposes to your S3 bucket. The following fields have been added to the JSON payload delivered to your S3 bucket each time a message is sent:

- `user_id`
- `campaign_name`
- `canvas_name`
- `canvas_step_name`

## New Liquid personalization tags

For in-app messages, you can use the following app attributes within Liquid. The values are based on which SDK API key your apps use to request messaging:

- {% raw %}`{{app.${api_id}}}`{% endraw %}
- {% raw %}`{{app.${name}}}`{% endraw %}

For more, refer to [Supported personalization tags]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/supported_personalization_tags#targeted-app-information).
