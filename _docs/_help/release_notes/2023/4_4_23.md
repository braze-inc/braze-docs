# April 4, 2023 release

## Creating catalogs in browser
You can use catalogs to reference non-user data in your Braze campaigns through Liquid. Braze now allows you to create a catalog directly in your browser instead of importing a CSV. Refer to [Creating a catalog]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/catalog) for more for more information.

### Updated API endpoints: catalog management

## Custom SQL in query builder
With the query builder, you can generate reports using Braze data in Snowflake. Now, you can [use custom SQL]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/query_builder/custom_sql) to unlock new insights.

{% alert important %}
The SQL editor is in early access. If you're interested in participating in the early access, reach out to your customer success manager.
{% endalert %}

## Message extras Liquid tag for Currents
Using the [`message_extras` Liquid tag]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/advanced_filters/message_extras), you can annotate your send events with dynamic data from Connected Content, custom attributes (such as language, country), and Canvas entry properties. This Liquid tag appends key-value pairs to the corresponding send event in Currents.

{% alert important %}
This Liquid tag is currently in beta for email, SMS, and push send events. Contact your Braze customer success manager if you're interested in participating in the beta.
