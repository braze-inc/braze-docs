# May 30, 2023 release

## Redesigned Braze navigation

We’ve updated the Braze navigation to help you create and access your content more quickly and efficiently. Features are now organized into intuitive categories familiar and relevant to a marketer’s workflow in Braze. For the next few months, you can switch back and forth between the old and new navigation experiences. For more information on what’s changed, refer to [Braze navigation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/navigation/).

## New Currents events

The following WhatsApp Currents events have recently been released and added to the [message engagement event]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events/) glossaries:

Message abort events:
- `users.messages.whatsapp.Send`
- `users.messages.whatsapp.Abort`

## In-browser catalog editing and catalog selections 

Catalogs now support in-browser editing and [selections]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/selections). Selections are groups of data that can be used to personalize a message for each user in your campaign. After creating a [catalog]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/), you can further reference this data by incorporating selections in your Braze campaigns.

## Currents and Snowflake Data Sharing message_extras Liquid tag

Using the [`message_extras` Liquid tag]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/advanced_filters/message_extras/), you can annotate your send events with dynamic data from Connected Content, Catalogs, custom attributes (such as language, country), Canvas entry properties, or other data sources, and send the extra data back to Currents or Snowflake Data Sharing.
