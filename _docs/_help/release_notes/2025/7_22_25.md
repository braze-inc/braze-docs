# July 22, 2025 release

## Security events export with Amazon S3

You can automatically [export Security Events to Amazon S3]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/company_settings/security_settings/security_export_s3/), a cloud storage provider, with a daily job that runs at midnight UTC. Once set up, you don't need to manually export Security Events from the dashboard.

## Data flexibility

### New Currents events: 

These new events were added to the Currents glossary:

- [Banner Abort events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events/#banner-abort-events)
- [Banner Click events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events/#banner-click-events)
- [Banner Impression events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events/#banner-impression-events)
- [Banner Viewed events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events/#banner-viewed-events)
- [Webhook Failure events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events/#webhook-failure-events)

### Default time range for campaign analytics

By default, the time range for [**Campaign Analytics**]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/reporting/campaign_analytics/) will display the last 90 days from the current time. This means that if the campaign was launched more than 90 days ago, the analytics will display as "0" for the given time range. To view all analytics for older campaigns, adjust the reporting time range.

### Updated behavior for Canvas Experiment Paths step

If your Canvas has an active or in-progress [experiment]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/experiment_step) and you update the active Canvas (even if it's not to the Experiment Path step), the in-progress experiment will end. To restart the experiment, you can disconnect the existing Experiment Path and launch a new one, or duplicate the Canvas and launch a new Canvas. 

For more information, refer to [Editing Canvases after launch]({{site.baseurl}}/post-launch_edits/).

### Faster rate limit available for /users/export/ids endpoint

You can also increase the [rate limit for the /users/export/ids endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/export/user_data/post_users_identifier/#rate-limit) to 40 requests per second by meeting the following requirements:

- Your workspace has the default rate limit (250 requests per minute) enabled. Contact your Braze account manager for further assistance with removing any pre-existing rate limit you may have.
- Your request includes the fields_to_export parameter to list out all the fields you want to receive.

### New translation for email templates endpoints

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

Use these endpoints to view and make updates to translations and locales for email templates:

- [GET: View the source translations]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/translations/email_templates/get_view_source_template)
- [GET: View a specific translation and locale for email template endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/translations/email_templates/get_view_translation_locale_template)
- [GET: View all translations and locales for an email template]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/translations/email_templates/get_view_translation_template)
- [PUT: Update translations for an email template]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/translations/email_templates/put_update_template)

## Unlocking creativity

### Landing pages

You can make your landing page [responsive to the size of a user's device]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/landing_pages/creating_pages#step-3-customize-the-page) by vertically stacking columns on smaller screens. To enable this, add a column into the row you want to make responsive, and then toggle on **Vertically stack on smaller screens** in the **Customize columns** section.

## Robust channels

### Self-serve custom domains

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

[Self-serve custom domains]({{site.baseurl}}/custom_domains/) empower you to configure and manage your own custom domains for SMS, RCS, and WhatsApp directly from your Braze dashboard. You can easily add, monitor, and manage up to 10 custom domains in one place.

### Bot filtering for emails

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Set up bot filtering in your [Email Preferences]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/email_settings) to exclude all suspected machine or bot clicks. A "bot click" in email refers to a click on hyperlinks within an email that's generated by an automated program. By filtering these bot clicks, you can intentionally trigger and deliver messages to recipients who are engaged.

### Drag-and-drop product blocks

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

The [drag-and-drop editor]({{site.baseurl}}/dnd_product_blocks/) empowers you to quickly add and configure product blocks to your messages for seamless product showcases, without the need to create custom Liquid code. The drag-and-drop product block feature is currently only available for email.

### Span text for landing pages and in-app messages

Span text allows you to apply specific styling to text blocks without custom code for your [landing pages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/landing_pages/creating_pages/#step-3-customize-the-page) and [in-app messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/drag_and_drop/style_settings/#blocks). To do so, highlight the text you want to style and then select **Wrap with span for style**. 

### Ad Click to WhatsApp

[Ads That Click to WhatsApp]({{site.baseurl}}/whatsapp_use_cases/) are an efficient way to bring both new and existing customers from Meta ads on Facebook, Instagram, or other platforms. Use these ads to promote your products and services while making users aware of your WhatsApp presence. 

## New Braze partnerships

### Okendo — eCommerce

The Braze and [Okendo]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/okendo/) integration works across multiple products in Okendo's platform, including Reviews, Loyalty, Referrals, Surveys, and Quizzes. Okendo sends custom events and user attributes to Braze, which can be used to personalize and trigger messages.

### Lemnisk — Customer Data Platform

The Braze and [Lemnisk]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/lemnisk/) integration allows brands and enterprises to unlock the full potential of Braze by acting as a CDP-led intelligence layer that unifies user data across platforms in real time, and sending the user's information and behaviors collected to Braze in real-time.

## SDK updates

The following SDK updates have been released. Breaking updates are listed below; all other updates can be found by checking the corresponding SDK changelogs.

- [Web SDK 6.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-web-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
    - Removed the `Banner.html` property, `logBannerClick`, and `logBannerImpressions` methods. Instead, use [`insertBanner`](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/modules/braze.html#insertbanner) which automatically handles impression and click tracking.
    - Removed support for the legacy News Feed feature. This includes removal of the Feed class, and its associated methods.
    - The created and categories fields that were used by legacy News Feed cards have been removed from [`Card`](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/classes/braze.card.html) subclasses.
    - The linkText field was also removed from the [`ImageOnly`](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/classes/braze.imageonly.html) Card subclass and its constructor.
    - Clarified definitions and updated types to note that certain SDK methods explicitly return undefined when the SDK is not initialized, aligning the typings with actual runtime behavior. This could introduce new TypeScript errors in projects that relied on the previous (incomplete) typings.
    - The images of in-app messages with `cropType` of `CENTER_CROP` (such as `FullScreenMessage` by default) are now rendered via an `<img>` tag instead of `<span>` for improved accessibility. This may break existing CSS customizations for the `.ab-center-cropped-img` class or its children.
- [Cordova SDK 13.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-cordova-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1300)
    - Updated the internal iOS implementation of `enableSdk` method to use setEnabled: instead of `_requestEnableSDKOnNextAppRun`, which was deprecated in the Swift SDK.
        - Calling this method no longer requires the app to be re-launched to take effect. The SDK will now become enabled as soon as this method is executed.
    - Updated the native Android bridge [from Braze Android SDK 36.0.0 to 37.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/compare/v36.0.0...v37.0.0#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed).
- [Android SDK 37.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- [Swift SDK 12.0.1-12.1.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
