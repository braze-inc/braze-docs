# June 24, 2025 release

## Data flexibility

### SAML just-in-time provisioning

Use [SAML just-in-time provisioning]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/single_sign_on/saml_jit) to allow new dashboard users to create a Braze account on their first sign in. This eliminates the need for administrators to manually create an account for a new dashboard user, choose their permissions, assign them to a workspace, and wait for them to activate their account.

## Robust channels

### Accessibility testing in Inbox Vision

Use [Accessibility testing]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/inbox_vision/#accessibility-testing) in Inbox Vision to highlight accessibility issues that may exist with your email. 

Accessibility testing analyzes your email content against some [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (WCAG) 2.2 AA requirements. This can provide insights into which elements aren't meeting accessibility standards.

## New Braze partnerships

### Stripe - eCommerce

The Braze and [Stripe]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/stripe) intergation allows you to trigger messaging in Braze based on Stripe events such as trial started, subscription activated, subscription cancellation, and more.
