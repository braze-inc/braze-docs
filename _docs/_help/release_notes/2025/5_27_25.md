### Update to Building accessible messages in Braze

We’ve updated our [Building accessible messages in Braze]({{site.baseurl}}/help/accessibility/) article with clearer, more prescriptive guidance on creating accessible messages. This article now includes expanded best practices for content structure, alt text, buttons, and color contrast, along with a new section on ARIA handling for custom HTML messages. 

This update is part of our broader effort to support more accessible messaging experiences in Braze. We know accessibility is an evolving area, and we’ll keep sharing what we learn.
