# March 4, 2025 release

## Developer Guide detangle

Identical content that's shared across multiple SDKs are starting to be merged together using the docs site's new SDK tabbing feature. This month [SDK integration]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/sdk_integration/), [SDK initialization]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/sdk_initialization/), and [Content Cards]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/content_cards/) were combined. Stay tuned for more updates in the coming months.

## Data flexibility
 
### Braze IDs for user profiles

A user profile now includes a [Braze ID]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/user_profiles#user-profiles). You can use this when searching for user profiles.

### Deferrals

Braze has updated our definition for what is a soft bounce and is sending a new event called [deferrals]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/reporting_and_analytics/email_reporting#email-performance), which is when an email was not immediately delivered, but Braze will retry the email for up to 72 hours after this temporary delivery failure to maximize the chances of successful delivery before attempts for that specific campaign are stopped.

### Snowflake entity relationships
 
We've mapped the [raw table schemas]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/download_file/data-sharing-raw-table-schemas.txt) for Snowflake and Braze entity relationships to a new [user-friendly docs page]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/data_warehouses/snowflake/entity_relationships). It includes a breakdown of the `USER_MESSAGES` tables belonging to each channel, as well as descriptions for each table's primary, foreign, and native keys.

### Identity management for external IDs

Using an email address or a hashed email address as your Braze external ID can simplify identity management across your data sources; however, it's important to consider the [potential risks]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/user_data_collection/user_profile_lifecycle/#identified-user-profiles) to user privacy and data security.
 
## Unlocking creativity

### Liquid tutorials

Added three [Liquid tutorials]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/operators/#tutorials) about how to use operators in the following scenarios.

  </tr>

    <td>Aborting a message based on location.</td>

  </tr>

### Context steps for Canvas
 
{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}
 
Use [Context steps]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/context) to create or update a set of variables that represent the context of a user (or insights into that user’s behavior) as they move through a Canvas.

### Personalized delay

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

You can set up a [personalized delay]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/delay_step/#personalized-delays) for your users by selecting the **Personalize delay** toggle in your Delay step. You can use this with a Context step to select a context variable to delay by.

When setting up a Delay step in your Canvas user journey, you can now create a delay up to 2 years.

### Reverting automatic synchronization

When [composing an email message]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/html_editor/creating_an_email_campaign/#step-3-compose-your-email), you can revert to automatic synchronization in the Plaintext tab by selecting the Regenerate from HTML icon, which only appears if the plaintext isn’t synchronizing.

## Robust channels

### Android Live Updates

Although Live Updates won’t be officially available until 
[Android 16](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/01/first-beta-android16.html), our [Live Updates for Android]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/push_notifications/live_notifications/?sdktab=android&tab=local) page shows you how to emulate their behavior, so you can display interactive lock-screen notifications similar to [Live Activities for the Swift Braze SDK]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/push_notifications/live_notifications/?sdktab=swift). Unlike official Live Updates, this functionality can be implemented for older Android versions.

### Copying campaigns with feature flags across workspaces

You can now [copy campaigns with feature flags across workspaces]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/managing_campaigns/copying_to_workspace/#copying-campaigns-with-feature-flags). To do so, make sure the destination workspace has a feature flag experiment configured with an ID that matches the feature flag referenced in the original campaign.

### New WhatsApp message types supported

WhatsApp messages now support [video, audio, and document outbound messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/whatsapp_campaign/create#outbound-messages). Contact your Braze account manager if you're interested in participating in the early access.

### Right-to-left messages

[Creating right-to-left messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/ideas_and_strategies/localizing_a_campaign/right_to_left_messages) covers best practices for crafting messages in languages that read right-to-left so that your messages display accurately as much as possible.
 
## AI and ML automation
 
### Item recommendations

[Using item recommendations in messaging]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/recommendations/using_recommendations) covers the `product_recommendation` Liquid object and includes a tutorial to help you put that knowledge into practice.

## New Braze partnerships
 
### Email Love - Channel Extensions
 
The Braze and [Email Love]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/email_templates) partnership leverages Email Love’s Export to Braze feature and the Braze API to upload your email templates to Braze seamlessly.

### VWO - A/B Testing
 
The Braze and [VWO]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/ab_testing/vwo) integration allows you to leverage VWO experiment data to create targeted segments and deliver personalized campaigns.
