### Okta Single Sign-On Update (SSO)

If your company uses Okta, your Okta admin can install the Braze app from the Okta application network. Then, they must put the Okta certificate into the Braze app’s Company Settings page, in the appropriate place in the Security Settings Tab.

Once activated, you can log into the Braze app using the Okta sign in button.

## Mobile Responsive Email Templates

Braze has 16 new mobile responsive email templates that fit common email marketing needs. These include different versions of the following template themes:

- Welcome
- Thank You
- Newsletter
- Order Confirmation
- Shipping Confirmation
- Product
- Event
- Information

Check them out in __Templates & Media__, in the basic [Email Templates section][97]. You’ll notice that the icons representing each template will show you their layout.
