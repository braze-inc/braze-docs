## Password Reusability

Administrators can now determine the minimum number of new, unique passwords other Braze users in their company must use before they can reuse a previous password. This can be controlled from the [Authentication Rules][98] panel in the _Company Settings_ tool (in the top-navigation dropdown menu), within the _Security Settings_ tab.

## Uninstall Tracking for Canvas Steps

Uninstalls per Canvas Steps are now tracked and viewable as a stat.
