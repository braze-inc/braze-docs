### Canvas Entry Settings Wizard

The Canvas UI will be simplified to prevent missed tasks and resulting errors. Canvas configurations, specifically, will now be displayed in a wizard, similar to the design of the **Campaigns** wizard. See the [updated Canvas documentation here]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/create_a_canvas/)!

### In-App Message Web Modal CSS

The [Web Modal CSS editor]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/create/#web-modal-css) has been updated and allows you more control over the look of your In-App Messages with our new [CSS Templates]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/in_app_message_color_templates/#css-template).
