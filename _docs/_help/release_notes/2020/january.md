Welcome to a New Year and New Decade! 

## Added SMS Capability

Braze now allows you to [cap the frequency]({{ site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/testing_and_more/rate-limiting/) of SMS messages as well as implement an added [segment filter]({{ site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/segmentation_filters/) "Last Received SMS".

In the SMS channel, the New User settings and behavior have been outlined and can be checked out [here](/docs/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/keywords/).
