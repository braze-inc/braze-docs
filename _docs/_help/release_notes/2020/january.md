# January 2020

Welcome to a New Year and New Decade! 

## Added SMS capability

Braze now allows you to [cap the frequency]({{ site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/testing_and_more/rate-limiting/) of SMS messages. You can also implement an added [segment filter]({{ site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/segmentation_filters/) "Last Received SMS".

For more information on user settings and behavior, check out [SMS keyword processing](/docs/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/keywords/)
