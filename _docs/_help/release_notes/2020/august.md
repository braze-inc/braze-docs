# August

## External ID migration endpoints

Braze has released two new External ID Migration endpoints. These endpoints allow customers to rename or remove their users' Braze external IDs by utilizing the Braze API. These endpoints can be leveraged to migrate users with different naming schemas  while retaining historical data on those users. Check out our docs to learn more about the [`users.external_ids.rename`]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/external_id_migration/post_external_ids_rename/) and [`users.external_ids.remove`]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/external_id_migration/post_external_ids_remove/) endpoints.

## Predictive Churn

Braze's Predictive Suite puts machine learning directly in your hands. Starting with [Predictive Churn]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/predictive_suite/), it's easier than ever to effectively leverage and act on data seamlessly within the Braze platform. With it, you can create a tailored machine learning model to predict the risk of churn for a specific customer base, and then message the users that machine learning determines are at-risk before it's too late. 

Previews of this feature will appear in eligible Braze customers' dashboards in early August. Contact your account manager for access to the full feature.
