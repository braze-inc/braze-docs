## Promotion codes

Using Liquid, you can have your messages pull from a list of [promotion codes]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/promotion_codes/#promotion-codes) you upload. This feature offers expiry dates of up to six months and supports u to 20MM individual codes per list.

## Variant retention report

When looking at a retention report for a [campaign]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/testing_and_more/retention_reports/) or [canvas]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/retention_reports/), you can now view the results broken down by variant. 

## 'Filter' option for campaigns and Canvases

The filter option for Canvas and campaign GET list endpoints allow your customers to know the last time a campaign or Canvas message was updated.

## Currents `ad-id`

Updated [storage connect documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events/#content-card-click-events) to reflect the new `ad-id` (advertiser ID) fields to Currents.

## BCC functionality

The [BCC Address setting]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/email_settings/) allows you to add and manage BCC address that can be appended to outbound email messages sent from Braze.
