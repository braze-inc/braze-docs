# March 2020

## Custom attribute filter behavior

The dashboard has [improved filters]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/#dates) to include more intuitive behaviors.
There have been two significant changes to how certain custom attributes filters work. 

The custom attribute filter changes are reflected in the filters: 
- Less than **X** Days Ago
- Less than **X** Days in the Future
- Day of Recurring Event<br>

If you use these filters in your segmentation, we recommend readjusting your segments to take these changes into account.
