## Retention reports

Braze is proud to now offer Retention Reports for campaigns. This feature helps measure user retention for users who have received any message in a specific campaign. Retention Reports can be found conveniently on the **Campaign Analytics** page within the dashboard. 

Information on this new feature can be found in our [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/testing_and_more/retention_reports/)

As of January 13th, 2020 this feature is not yet available to our client deployed in our EU region or our HIPPA-compliant cluster. We will make this report available to those regions as we continue to deploy functionality across our entire platform.
