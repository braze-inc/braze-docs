# February 6, 2024 release

## Braze privacy manifest

Braze has released our own privacy manifest, along with new flexible APIs that automatically reroute declared tracking data to dedicated `-tracking` endpoints. For more information, see [Braze's privacy manifest]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/analytics/managing_data_collection/?sdktab=swift#swift_privacy-manifest).

## Google EU User Consent Policy

Google is updating their [EU User Consent Policy](https://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy/) in response to changes to the [Digital Markets Act (DMA)](https://ads-developers.googleblog.com/2023/10/updates-to-customer-match-conversion.html), which goes into effect March 6, 2024. This new change requires advertisers to disclose certain information to their EEA and UK end users, as well as obtain necessary consents from them. As part of this upcoming change, you can [collect both consent signals in Braze as custom attributes]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/canvas_steps/google_audience_sync/#collecting-consent-for-eea-and-uk-end-users). Braze will sync the data from these custom attributes to the appropriate consent fields in Google.

## Data flexibility

### Google Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) API

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You now can [migrate from Google’s deprecated Cloud Messaging API to their fully-supported Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) API]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/push_notifications/?sdktab=android). 

### Braze Cloud Data Ingestion (CDI) endpoints

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Use Braze CDI endpoints to:
- [Return a list of existing integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/cdi/get_integration_list/).
- [Return a list of past sync statuses]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/cdi/get_job_sync_status/) for a given integration.
- [Trigger a sync]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/cdi/post_job_sync/) for a given integration.

### Braze Cloud Data Ingestion (CDI) support for Databricks

Braze CDI support for catalogs is now available for [Databricks sources]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/cloud_ingestion/sync_catalogs_data/#step-2-integrate-cloud-data-ingestion-with-catalog-data).

### Manual Swift SDK integration

We added the [Manual integration]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/sdk_integration?tab=manual) article to the integration guides to describe how to manually integrate the Swift SDK without the use of a package manager.

## Deprecations

On January 11, 2024, Braze stopped serving messages and collecting data from Windows apps and Baidu apps.

## Unlocking creativity

### SQL Segment Extensions use cases

The [SQL Segment Extensions use cases]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/sql_segments/use_cases) library contains tested queries for SQL Segment Extensions that you can use for inspiration when creating your own SQL queries.

## Robust channels

### Custom Code blocks

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

[Custom Code blocks]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/drag_and_drop/editor_blocks/#custom-code) allow you to add, edit, or delete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an in-app message.

### Reduce payload size of push notifications

The new help article [Notification Payload Size]({{site.baseurl}}/help/help_articles/push/reducing_payload_size#reducing-push-notification-payload-size) provides some tips to reduce the payload size of your push notifications if you're unable to launch a campaign or Canvas step due to push payload size limits.

### Add BCC addresses to your campaign or Canvas

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can append a [BCC address]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/email_settings/?tab=bcc%20address#outbound-email-settings) to an email message. This will send an identical copy of the message your user receives to your BCC inbox. This allows you to retain copies of messages you sent your users for compliance requirements or customer support issues.

### One-click unsubscribe links for emails

Using a [list-unsubscribe header]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/email_settings/#list-unsubscribe-header) allows your recipients to unsubscribe with one click from marketing emails by displaying an **Unsubscribe** button within the mailbox UI, and not the message body.

## New Braze partnerships

### Criteo - Canvas Audience Sync

Using the [Braze Audience Sync to Criteo]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/canvas_steps/criteo_audience_sync/), brands can elect to add user data from their own Braze integration to Criteo customer lists to deliver advertisements based upon behavioral triggers, segmentation and more. Any criteria you’d normally use to trigger a message (push, email, SMS, webhook, etc.) in a Braze Canvas based upon your user data can now be used to trigger an ad to that user in your Criteo customer lists.

### Movable Ink - Dynamic content

The [Movable Ink]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_personalization/dynamic_content/movable_ink#movable-ink) Customer Data API integration allows marketers to activate customer event data stored in Braze to generate personalized content within Movable Ink.

### Scuba Analytics - Analytics

[Scuba Analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/analytics/scuba#scuba-analytics) is a full-stack, machine-learning-powered data collaboration platform designed for high-velocity time-series data. Scuba allows you to selectively export users (also called actors) and load them into your Braze platform. In Scuba, custom actor properties are used to analyze behavioral trends, activate your data across various platforms, and conduct predictive modeling using machine learning.
