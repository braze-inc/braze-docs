# January 9, 2024 release

## Updated Shopify integration documentation

We've updated sections of our Braze and Shopify integration documentation, including:

- [Getting started with Shopify]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/ecommerce/shopify/getting_started_shopify/)
- [Setting up Shopify in Braze]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/ecommerce/shopify/setting_up_shopify/)
- [Shopify user identity management]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/ecommerce/shopify/shopify_features/shopify_user_identity/)

## Data flexibility

### Back-in-stock notifications for catalogs

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

Using a combination of [back-in-stock notifications]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs/catalog_triggers/back_in_stock_notifications/) through catalogs and a Canvas, you can notify customers when an item is back-in-stock. Any time a customer performs a selected custom event, they can be automatically subscribed to be notified when the item is replenished.

### Catalog segments

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

[Catalog segments]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/sql_segments/catalog_segments/) are an audience of users based on catalog data in SQL Segment Extensions. These SQL Segment Extensions can be referenced in a segment and then targeted by campaigns and Canvases. Catalog segments use SQL to join data from catalogs and data from custom events or purchases. To do so, you must have a common identifier field across your catalogs and your custom events or purchases.

### Migrating to the Firebase Cloud Messaging API

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

Learn [how to migrate]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/push_notifications/?sdktab=android) from Googleâ€™s deprecated Cloud Messaging API to their fully-supported Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) API.
