## Data flexibility

### Attachments for API-triggered campaigns

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

The [`/campaigns/trigger/send` endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/messaging/send_messages/post_send_triggered_campaigns) now supports attachments (just like the `/messages/send` endpoint supports attachments for emails). 

### Additional data warehouse support

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

Braze [Cloud Data Ingestion (CDI)]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/cloud_ingestion/connected_sources/) now supports BigQuery, Databricks, Redshift, and Snowflake.

### WhatsApp phone number migration

Migrate your WhatsApp phone number between WhatsApp Business Accounts by using Meta's Embedded Signup. Read more about [WhatsApp phone number migration]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/overview/phone_number_migration).
 
## Unlocking creativity

### Engagement by Device

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

The new **Engagement by Device** report provides a breakdown of what devices your users are using to engage with your email. This data tracks email engagement across mobile, desktop, tablet, and other device types. Learn more about [the report and the Email Performance Dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/analytics/dashboard/email_performance_dashboard/).

### WhatsApp and SMS Liquid properties in Canvas flow

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

We added support for [WhatsApp and SMS Liquid properties in Canvas flow]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/canvas_entry_properties_event_properties). Now, when an Action Path step contains a "Sent an SMS Inbound Message" or "Sent a WhatsApp Inbound Message" trigger, the subsequent Canvas steps can include an SMS or WhatsApp Liquid property. This mirrors how event properties work in Canvas Flow. This way you can leverage your messages to save and reference first-party data on user profiles and conversational messaging.
 
### Personalized Paths in recurring Canvases

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

Personalized Paths in Canvases let you personalize any point of a Canvas journey for individual users based on conversion likelihood. Now, Personalized Paths are available for recurring Canvases. Learn more about [Personalized Variants]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/experiment_step/personalized_paths).

### Segments troubleshooting

Working with segments? Here are some [troubleshooting steps and considerations]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/troubleshooting) to keep in mind.

### Liquid highlighting

We improved the [color-coding that Liquid uses]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid) to better support accessibility guidelines.

## Robust channels

### SMS geographic permissions

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

SMS geographic permissions enhance security and protect against fraudulent SMS traffic by enforcing controls on the countries to which you can send SMS messages. Admins can now specify an allowlist of countries to make sure that SMS messages are only sent to approved regions. For more information, see [SMS Geographic Permissions]({{site.baseurl}}/sms_geographic_permissions).

### Best practices for SMS/MMS

Learn more about [best practices for SMS/MMS with Braze]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/best_practices/best_practices), including our recommendations for opt-out monitoring and traffic pumping. 

### Tracking push unsubscribes
