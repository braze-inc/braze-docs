# April 2, 2024 release

## WhatsApp

### Multiple business accounts

Now you can add multiple WhatsApp Business accounts and subscription groups to each workspace. For a full walkthrough, see [Multiple WhatsApp Business accounts and phone numbers]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/overview/multiple_subscription_groups/).

### Read rates

WhatsApp is testing new approaches, starting with consumers in India, to create more valuable experiences and maximize engagement with businessesâ€™ marketing conversations. This may include limiting the number of marketing conversations a person receives from any business in a given period, starting with a small number of conversations that are less likely to be read.
