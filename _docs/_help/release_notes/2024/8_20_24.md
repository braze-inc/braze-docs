# August 20, 2024 release

## New use cases

### Catalogs

You can bring in any type of data into a catalog. Typically, the data is metadata about offerings, such as products, discounts, promotions, events, and similar. Read our [use cases]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalogs) and learn how you can use this data to target users with highly relevant messaging.

### Intelligence Suite

The Intelligence Suite provides powerful features to analyze user history and campaign and Canvas performance, then make automatic adjustments to increase engagement, viewership, and conversions. For a few examples of how these features can benefit different industries, check out our [use cases]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/intelligence).

## Home dashboard update

You can [pick up where you left off]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/analytics/home_dashboard/#pick-up-where-you-left-off) in the Braze dashboard with easy access to files you've recently edited or created. This section appears at the top of the **Home** page of the Braze dashboard.

## Data flexibility

### Data Transformation templates and new destination

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Build your Data Transformation using our dedicated [template library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/data_transformation/creating_a_transformation#step-2-create-a-transformation) to help you get started with certain external platforms, instead of default code. You can now select **POST: Send messages immediately via API Only** as your destination to transform webhooks from a source platform to send immediate messages to your users.

### Merge users in bulk

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

If you encounter duplicate user profiles, you can [bulk merge]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/user_profiles/duplicate_users#bulk-merging) these users to help streamline your data.

### Export custom attributes

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

You can [export the list of custom attributes]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/#exporting-data) as a CSV file by selecting **Export all** on the **Custom Attributes** page. The CSV file will be generated, and a download link will be emailed to you.

### Currents IP allowlisting

Braze will send Currents data from the listed IPs, which are automatically and dynamically added to any API keys that have been opted-in for [allowlisting]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/setting_up_currents).

## Robust channels

### New segment builder experience

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Build a segment using our [updated experience]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/creating_a_segment). Segments update in real-time as data changes, and you can create as many segments as needed for your targeting and messaging purposes.

### Metrics by segments

Use [Query Builder]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/query_builder/) report templates to break down performance metrics for campaigns, Canvas, variants, and steps by segments.

### Phone number acquisition

To use the WhatsApp messaging channel, you'll need a phone number that meets WhatsApp’s requirements for its [Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/phone-numbers) or [On-Premises API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/phone-numbers). 

You must acquire your phone number yourself, as Braze won't provision the number for you. You can either purchase a physical phone with a SIM card through your business phone provider or use one of our partners: Twilio or Infoblip. **You must have your own Twilio or Infobip account because this cannot be done through Braze.**

## New Braze partnerships

### Zendesk Chat - Instant Chat

The Braze and [Zendesk Chat]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/zendesk_chat/) integration uses webhooks from each platform to set up a two-way SMS conversation. When a user requests support, a ticket is created in Zendesk. Agent responses are forwarded to Braze through an API-triggered SMS campaign, and user replies are sent back to Zendesk.

## SDK updates

The following SDK updates have been released. Breaking updates are listed below; all other updates can be found by checking the corresponding SDK changelogs.
