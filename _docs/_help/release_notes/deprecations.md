Support for the [Twilio webhook integration]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/twilio/) has been discontinued as of January 31, 2020. If you wish to still access SMS services with Braze, see our [SMS documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/).

## Apptimize partnership

**Support withdrawn**: August 2019

If you are currently using [Apptimize with Braze]({{site.baseurl}}/help/release_notes/deprecations/apptimize), you will not experience a disruption of service. You can still set Apptimize custom attributes to Braze user profiles. However, no formal escalation support with the partner will be provided.

## Original in-app messages

**Support withdrawn:** February 2019<br>
**Replaced by**: [In-App Messaging]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/creating_an_in-app_message)

Braze has improved the look and feel of in-app messages to adhere to the latest UX and UI best practices and no longer supports the original in-app messages.

Braze moved over to a new form of in-app messages with the following SDK releases:
- iOS: `2.19.0`
- Android: `1.13.0`
- Web: `1.3.0`

Prior to these releases, Braze supported "original in-app messages." Previously, support for original in-app messages was provided for any customer who ran an in-app campaign prior to the new release. All of the campaign stats were unaffected by the change, and those who had sent original in-app messages had the opportunity to send others via the **Create Campaign** button on the **Campaign** page.

## Feedback widget

**Support withdrawn**: July 1, 2019.

The Braze SDK provided a feedback widget that could be added to your app to allow users to leave feedback using the `submitfeedback` method and pass it into either Desk.com or Zendesk and was managed on the dashboard.

## Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)

**Support withdrawn**: Braze removal of support: July 2018, Google removal of support: May 29, 2019<br>
**Replaced by**: [Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/push_notifications/integration/standard_integration/#step-1-enable-firebase)

Google has [removed support for GCM](https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/04/time-to-upgrade-from-gcm-to-fcm.html) as of May 29, 2019. Braze has discountinued support for GCM from the Android SDKs in July 2018, which was noted within our [Android SDK changelogs](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). This means that existing GCM tokens will continue to work, and you will be able to message your existing users. However, you will not be able to message new users.

Customers that have not already migrated to [Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/push_notifications/integration/standard_integration/#step-1-enable-firebase) may be affected by this change.

If you have not transitioned to FCM, all GCM push tokens registrations will fail. If your apps are currently supporting GCM, youâ€™ll need to work with your development teams on [transitioning from GCM to Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/android-migrate-fcm).

## Eclipse

**Support withdrawn**: 2014-2015<br>
**Replaced by**: [Android Studio]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/initial_sdk_setup/android_sdk_integration/#using-android-studio)

Braze has discountinued support for the Eclipse IDE due to Google [sunsetting support](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2015/06/an-update-on-eclipse-android-developer.html) for the Eclipse Android Developer Tools (ADT) plugin. 

If you need assistance with your Eclipse integration prior to migration, contact [Support]({{site.baseurl}}/support_contact/) for assistance.

## The Raw Event Stream (RES)

**Support withdrawn**: July 2018<br>
**Replaced by**: [Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/braze_currents/about/)

The Raw Event Stream was the predecessor to [Currents]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/braze_currents/about/) and was deprecated to make room for the future of Braze data.

## Delay while idle - GCM feature

**Support withdrawn**: November 2016

The Delay While Idle parameter was previously a part of the [GCM push options](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref). Google withdrew support for this option on November 15, 2016. Previously, when set to **true**, it indicated that the message should not be sent until the device becomes active.

## Custom endpoints

**Support withdrawn**: December 2019

Removal of Custom Endpoints. If you have a custom endpoint, you can continue to use it, but Braze no longer gives them out.
