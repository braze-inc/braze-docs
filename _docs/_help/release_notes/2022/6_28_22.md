# June 6, 2022 release

## Delivery validation for Canvas Message Steps

You can turn on delivery validation in your Canvas [Message Steps]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/message_step/) to provide an additional check to confirm your audience meets the delivery criteria at message send. This setting is recommended if Quiet Hours, Intelligent Timing, or rate limiting are activated.

## Android 13 SDK upgrade guide

As of June 8, 2022 Android 13 has reached its [Platform Stability Milestone](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/overview#platform_stability).
