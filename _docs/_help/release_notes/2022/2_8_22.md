# February 8, 2022 release

## Canvas Action Paths

[Action Paths]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/action_paths/) allow you to sort your users based on their actions. Using Action Paths, you can:
- Customize user paths based on a specific action. 
- Hold users for a given duration to prioritize their next path based on their actions during this evaluation period. 

Access to Action Paths will be rolled out slowly to all Braze instances. Contact your Braze account manager to learn more.

After this date, v2 and v2.5 will no longer be operational, and relevant requests will fail. Users of this partner integration are urged to update their API version before this date.
