# March 8, 2022 release

## In-app messages for Roku

Braze now supports sending in-app messages to your users on their Roku devices! Note that this requires additional SDK configuration and is not available out-of-the-box. For more information on integrating in-app messages for Roku, refer to [Roku in-app messages]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/roku/in-app_messaging/overview/).

## Full Filter Mode for Churn Predictions and Purchase Predictions

In order to build a new prediction immediately, only a subset of Braze segmentation filters are supported by default. You can now enable Full Filter Mode to enable all segmentation filters, however this mode limits you to one window when building the prediction. For more, refer to the following articles:

- [Creating a Churn Prediction]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/predictive_suite/predictive_churn/creating_a_churn_prediction/#full-filter-mode)
- [Creating a Purchase Prediction]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/predictive_suite/predictive_purchases/creating_a_purchase_prediction/#full-filter-mode)

## Retargeting option for keyword responses

When viewing analytics for an SMS campaign, you can now conveniently create a segment for retargeting based on the users who responded with a specific keyword category. For more information, refer to [Keyword Responses]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/sms_campaign_analytics/#keyword-responses) in SMS reporting.

## Data collection best practices

Have you wondered when and how you should collect user data when you're handling both known and unknown users? We know the lifecycle of a user profile in Braze can be a bit confusing, so we put together some [data collection best practices]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/user_data_collection/best_practices/) to help clarify different methods and best practices for collecting new and existing user data.

## Transifex API deprecation

As of April 7, 2022, Transifex is deprecating their API versions 2 and 2.5 to make way for version 3. After this date, v2 and v2.5 will no longer be operational, and relevant requests will fail. If you are leveraging the Transifex API, update your Connected Content calls accordingly. For more information, refer to [Transifex]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_personalization/localization/transifex/).

## New Braze partnerships
