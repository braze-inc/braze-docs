## New Braze partnerships

### IAM Studio - Message templates

With the Braze and [IAM Studio]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/email_templates/iam_studio/) integration, you can easily insert customizable in-app message templates into your Braze in-app messages, offering image replacement, text modification, deep link settings, custom attributes, and event settings. Using IAM Studio, you can reduce message production time and dedicate more time to content planning.

### actionable.me - Analytics

The Braze and [actionable.me]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/analytics/actionableme/) integration allows you to deploy a service to monitor your progress in the utilization of Braze. Through a combination of tools and processes, they will rapidly benchmark your CRM performance, identify new opportunities and provide recommendations on how to perform better.

### Storyly - Cohort import

The Braze and [Storyly]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/cohort_import/storyly/) integration allows you to use your segments in Braze as an audience in the Storyly platform. With this integration, you can:

- Target your segments with specific stories
- Use user attributes to personalize your story contents

### Lokalise - Localization

The Braze and [Lokalise]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_personalization/localization/lokalise/) integration leverages Connected Content to allow you to easily insert translated content into your Braze campaigns based on user language settings.

### Quikly - Retargeting

The Braze and [Quikly]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/additional_channels/retargeting/quikly/) partnership allows you to accelerate conversions on events within a Braze customer journey. Quikly does this by using urgency psychology to motivate consumers in fun — and instant — ways. For example, brands can use Quikly to immediately acquire new email and SMS subscribers directly into Braze or to motivate other key marketing objectives like downloading your mobile app.

### DataGrail - Data privacy and compliance

The Braze and [DataGrail]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/data_privacy/datagrail/) integration allows you to detect consumer data collected and stored within Braze to quickly process DSRs (access, delete, and do-not-sell requests). Braze will be added to an accurate blueprint of where consumer data lives in your organization with automated data mapping — no more surveys or spreadsheets are needed to maintain a privacy framework or produce a record of processing activities (RoPA).
