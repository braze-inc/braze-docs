## Canvas Flow
The newest version of the Canvas product, [Canvas Flow]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/create_a_canvas/#editing-a-step) has been released. With Canvas Flow you get access to lightweight [Canvas components]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/about/), [persistent entry properties]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/canvas_entry_properties_event_properties/canvas_persistent_entry_properties/), and [post-launch editing]({{site.baseurl}}/post-launch_edits).

## Array of objects
Use an [array of objects]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/array_of_objects#array-of-objects) to group related attributes. For example, you may have a group of pet objects, song objects, and account objects that all belong to one user. These arrays of objects can be used to personalize your messaging with Liquid, or create audience segments if any element within an object matches the criteria.

## Updated partner integrations
[Amplitude Recommend]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_analytics/customer_data_platform/amplitude/amplitude_audiences) and [mParticle]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_analytics/customer_data_platform/mParticle/mparticle/) now have updated integration steps. If you leverage these partners, visit their documentation to ensure you have followed the most recent setup.

## Shopify requirements
- Required user permissions listed under [prerequisites]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/ecommerce/shopify/shopify/#prerequisites) have been updated.
- Example Shopify [payloads]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/ecommerce/shopify/shopify/#supported-shopify-events) that include the `price`, `total_price`, `total_discounts`, and `amount` properties have been updated to format these properties as numbers instead of strings.

## Prediction updates

## SDK updates
The following SDK updates have been released. Breaking updates are listed below; all other updates can be found by checking the corresponding SDK changelogs.
- [Web SDK 4.1.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-web-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#410)
- [Cordova SDK 2.30.1](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-cordova-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2301)

- [React Native SDK 1.37.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1370)
  - The Braze React Native SDK now exports its default object as an ES Module. If you currently import the SDK using `require()`, you will need to now import it as a standard ES Module (for example, import Braze from "`@braze/react-native-sdk`").
- [Android SDK 22.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2200)
  - `Appboy.java` is now `Braze.kt`. Kotlin clients will need to update their code to support the use of Kotlin properties on the Braze singleton where needed.
    - `Braze.registerPushToken()`/`Braze.getRegisteredPushToken()` is now `Braze.setRegisteredPushToken()/Braze.getRegisteredPushToken()`. If using Kotlin, use the property `Braze.registeredPushToken`.
    - `Braze.getDeviceId` is now just `Braze.deviceId` for Kotlin.
    - `Braze.enableMockNetworkAppboyRequestsAndDropEventsMode` is now `Braze.enableMockNetworkRequestsAndDropEventsMode()`.
    - `Appboy.java` has been removed. For example, calls like `Appboy.getInstance()` will need to be `Braze.getInstance()` moving forward.
    - Replaced `setCustomAppboyNotificationFactory()` with `setCustomBrazeNotificationFactory()` / `customBrazeNotificationFactory`.
    - Renamed `enableMockAppboyNetworkRequestsAndDropEventsMode` to `enableMockNetworkRequestsAndDropEventsMode`.
  - Moved `com.appboy.IBrazeEndpointProvider` to `com.braze.IBrazeEndpointProvider`.
  - Renamed `com.braze.events.IEventSubscriber` to `com.braze.events.IEventSubscriber`.
  - Removed `Appboy.registerAppboyPushMessages()` / `Appboy.getAppboyPushMessageRegistrationId()`. Replaced with `getRegisteredPushToken()` / `setRegisteredPushToken()`.
  - Replaced `IAppboyNotificationFactory` with `IBrazeNotificationFactory`.
  - Removed `com.appboy.ui.inappmessage.listeners.IHtmlInAppMessageActionListener`. Use `com.braze.ui.inappmessage.listeners.IHtmlInAppMessageActionListener` instead.
