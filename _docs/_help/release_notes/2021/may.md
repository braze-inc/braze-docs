## iOS push advanced implementation guide
This detailed guide covers how to leverage push notification content app extensions to get the most out of your push messages. Included are three custom use cases built by our team (interactive push, data capture push, and progress-based push), accompanying code snippets, and guidance on logging analytics. Visit our documentation here to read [more](/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/push_notifications/implementation_guide/).

## VFC support for multimedia message service (mms)
vCards, also known as Virtual Contact Files (.VCF), are a standardized file format for sending business/contact information that can be easily imported into address/contact books. These VFC files can now be sent through MMS and added to the Braze media library. Visit our MMS documentation to [learn more]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/mms/create/). 

## Updates to user delete
