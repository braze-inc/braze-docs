## Click-to-Open Rate reporting metric
Braze has added a new email metric, Click-to-Open Rate, available in the [Report Builder]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/your_reports/report_builder/). This metric represents the percentage of open emails that have been clicked.

## Machine Open reporting metric

A new email metric, [Machine Opens]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/reporting_and_analytics/analytics_glossary/#machine-opens), is available on the Canvas and Campaign Analytics pages for emails.

## New Braze partnerships

### Adobe - Customer data platform
The Braze and [Adobe]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/customer_data_platform/adobe/#adobe) integration allows brands to connect and map their Adobe data (custom attributes and segments) to Braze in real-time. Brands can then act on this data, delivering personalized, targeted experiences to those users. 

### BlueConic - Customer data platform
With [Blueconic]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/customer_data_platform/blueconic/#blueconic), Braze users can unify data into persistent, individual profiles and then sync it across customer touchpoints and systems in support of a wide range of growth-focused initiatives, including customer lifecycle orchestration, modeling and analytics, digital products and experiences, audience-based monetization, and more.

### Worthy - Dynamic content
The Braze and [Worthy]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_personalization/dynamic_content/worthy/#worthy) integration allows you to easily create personalized, rich in-app experiences using Worthyâ€™s drag and drop dynamic content editor and deliver them through Braze.

### Judo - Dynamic content
The [Judo]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_personalization/dynamic_content/judo/#judo) and Braze integration allows you to overwrite components of your campaign and replace them with Judo experiences. Data from Braze may be used to support personalized content in a Judo experience. User events and data from the experience can feedback into Braze for attribution and targeting.

### Line - Messaging
The [Line]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/additional_channels/messaging/line/#line) and Braze integration allows you to leverage Braze webhooks, advanced segmentation, personalization, and triggering features to message your users in Line through the [Line Messaging API](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/overview/).

### RevenueCat - Payments
The [RevenueCat]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/payments/revenuecat/#revenuecat) and Braze integration allows you to automatically sync your customer's purchase and subscription lifecycle events across platforms. This allows you to build campaigns that react to the subscription lifecycle stage of your customers, such as engaging with customers that opted out during their free trial or sending reminders to customers with billing issues.

### Punchh - Loyalty
[Punchh]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/loyalty/punchh/#punchh) has partnered with Braze to sync data across the two platforms for gifting and loyalty purposes.
