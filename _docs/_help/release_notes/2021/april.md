## Segment Extension
A [Segment Extension]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/segment_extension) expands our existing segmentation capabilities by enabling you to target more precise lists of users based on their custom event and purchase behavior in the past 365 days. Once these extension lists are generated, they can then be included/excluded as a filter in your Segments. When creating a Segment Extension, you can also specify that the list be regenerated once every 24 hours.

## A2P 10DLC
A2P 10DLC refers to a system in the United States that allows businesses to send Application-to-Person (A2P) type messaging via a standard 10-digit long code (10DLC) phone number. 10-digit long codes have traditionally been designed for Person-to-Person (P2P) traffic, causing businesses to be constrained by limited throughput and heightened filtering. __All customers who currently have and/or use long codes are required to register their long codes for 10DLC__. To read more about A2P 10DLC, visit our documentation [here]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/phone_numbers/short_and_long_codes/#application-to-person-10-digit-long-codes-a2p-10dlc).

## Global Control Groups
[Global Control Groups]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/testing/global_control_group/) allow you to analyze the overall impact of your messaging efforts over time. These Groups can help you understand how your marketing campaigns and Canvases result in an uplift in sessions and custom events, by comparing the behaviors of users that receive messaging to those that don’t.
