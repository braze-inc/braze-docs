# August 2021

## Simple Survey in-app message

Use the new [Simple Survey in-app message template]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/templates/simple_survey/) to collect user attributes, insights, and preferences that power your campaign strategy. For example, you can ask users how they’d like to use your app, learn more about their personal preferences, or even ask about their satisfaction with a particular feature. This survey template is supported for both mobile apps and web browsers.

## Liquid use case library

Wondering how to do that one thing with Liquid? Just looking for inspiration? Check out our new [Liquid Use Case Library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/liquid_use_cases/) for a collection of use cases ranging from anniversaries and birthdays to platform targeting and more.

## Email tracking

Open pixel tracking and click tracking can now be disabled per user profile. This flexibility helps customers support regional privacy laws, where an individual user profile might indicate they no longer want to be tracked.
