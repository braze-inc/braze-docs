# October 2021

## iOS 15

### Apple Mail Privacy Protection 

Appleâ€™s Mail Privacy Protection (MPP) is a privacy update that will be available for users of the Apple Mail app on iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS Monterey, and watchOS 8, released in mid-September. For users who opt-in to MPP, emails will now be preloaded using proxy servers, caching images and hindering the ability to leverage tracking pixels for metrics like [open tracking]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_app_group/email_settings/#email-open-tracking-pixel/). To learn more about MPP and issues regarding email deliverability metrics and issues with pre-existing campaigns and Canvases that trigger based on these metrics, visit our [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/mpp/).

### Push features

iOS 15 introduced new notification features to help users stay focused and avoid frequent interruptions throughout the day. We're excited to offer support for these new features, including [Interruption Levels and Relevance Scores]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/push/ios/notification_options/).
