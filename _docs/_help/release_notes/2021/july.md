# July 2021

## Transactional email campaigns

Transactional emails are those sent to facilitate an agreed-upon transaction between a sender and the recipient. Braze's [Transactional email campaign]({{site.baseurl}}/api/api_campaigns/transactional_campaigns) is purpose-built for sending automated, non-promotional email messages like order confirmations, password resets, billing alerts, or other business-critical notifications. In addition, a corresponding [transactional email endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/messaging/send_messages/post_send_transactional_message/) has been created. Transactional emails and the new endpoint are only available as part of select Braze packages. 

## Nested object support for event properties

Braze now supports [nested objects]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/nested_object_support/) for custom events and purchase events. Nested objects allow you to send arrays of data as properties of custom events and purchases. This nested data can be used for templating personalized information in API-triggered messages through the use of Liquid and dot notation.

## New HMAC Liquid filters

New [`hmac_sha1` and `hmac_sha256` Liquid encoding filters]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/advanced_filters/) have been added to the Braze platform.
