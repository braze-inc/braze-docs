## Currents

[Currents][75] displays a set of real-time, high volume data connections for customer data with pre-built connections directly into technologies like data warehouses, business intelligence tools, and data management platforms.

## Okta single sign-on (October 2017)

Companies can use Okta to control Braze access and allow or force their fellow Braze users to log in using Okta credentials. To gain access to this new product, contact your customer success manager, account manager, or open a [support ticket][support].

> Update: Information about how to access Okta can be found in our [May 2018 Release Notes]({{site.baseurl}}/help/release_notes/2017/august/#may-2018).

## Updated email footer length restriction

The limit to [email footers][76] is now 100kb. This update is in line with email best practices, as emails with bodies of larger than 400kb are more likely to land in spam.
