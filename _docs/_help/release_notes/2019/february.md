## Email subscription groups

[Subscription Groups]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/managing_user_subscriptions/#subscription-groups) are segment filters that can further narrow your audience from the [Global Subscription States]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/managing_user_subscriptions/) above. These groups offer the ability to present more granular subscription options to end users.

For example, if you send out multiple categories of email campaigns, you can offer your customers the option to subscribe or unsubscribe from those groups in bulk from a single page, using our [email preference center](#email-preference-center).

Use the [Subscription Group REST APIs]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/rest_api/subscription_group_api/) to programmatically manage the subscription groups that you have stored on the Braze dashboard to the Subscription Group page.

## Email preference center

The [email preference center]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/managing_user_subscriptions/#email-preference-center) is an easy way to manage which users receive certain groups of newsletters. Each subscription group you create is added to the preference center list. Click on the name of the preference center to see an interactive preview.
