More to come! Check back later this month for more updates!

## Intelligence Suite

Braze's [Intelligence Suite]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/intelligence/) helps you automate decision-making with data-based insights. From delivery time to multivariate testing, brands can use these tools and features to create dynamic, cross-channel experiences that optimize at scale. <br> <br> The Intelligence Suite comprises of three main features: [Intelligent Timing]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/intelligence/intelligent_timing/), [Intelligent Channel]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/intelligence/intelligent_channel/), and [Intelligent Selection]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/brazeai/intelligence/intelligent_selection/).

{% alert note %}
The "Intelligence Suite" is a revision and grouping of features previously known as "Most Engaged Channel", "Intelligent Timing", and "multivariate and A/B testing".

## Dark Mode themes for in-app messages

iOS 13 and Android 10 both introduced settings that allowed mobile phones to change their color themes to a "Dark Mode". Aligning with this feature, Braze has introduced [Dark Mode for in-app messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/traditional/dark-mode/)! This feature allows you to create in-app messages with a "light" and a "dark theme". If a device you send to has "Dark Mode" activated, the message will display your selected Dark Mode Theme.
