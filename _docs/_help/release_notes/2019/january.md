# January 2019

Welcome to a new year!

## Push time to live (TTL)

In your account, within **Manage Settings**, click the [push TTL Settings]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/push_settings/) tab to manage the time duration for attempted resends in the event that a device is offline.

## Connected Content IP whitelisting

Braze is pleased to announce that due to a number of infrastructure upgrades made by our internal teams, we can now offer IP whitelisting for Connected Content on all clusters. In the future, we plan to add additional IPs for the non-EU clusters.

## Canvas delay

We have added the option for any Canvas step to be sent immediately.
