# March 2019

## In-app messages - Generation 3

Braze is proud to announce that we have made improvements to the look and feel of our in-app messages to adhere to the latest UX and UI best practices. In the newest in-app messages, you can expect your users to interact with messages with:
- Larger font sizes
- Refined spacing
- A new close `x` asset
- Improved responsive behavior for all message types to better fit viewports
- Button borders to create custom contrasts between buttons

Our [new in-app messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/) will take your interactions with your user from good to app-mazing!

### What you need to do

We highly recommend updating to the latest versions of the Braze SDKs for [Web]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/initial_sdk_setup/#upgrading-the-sdk), [iOS]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/sdk_integration/?sdktab=swift), and [Android]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/sdk_integration/?sdktab=android).

After that, you're good to go!

## Content Blocks archive update

You can now archive and unarchive [Content Blocks]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/content_blocks/#archiving-content-blocks).

## Inkit partner addition

You can now use [Inkit]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/inkit/) as a predesigned webhook template or create a new webhook campaign.

## Google Cloud Storage

[Google Cloud Storage]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_analytics/cloud_storage/google_cloud_storage_for_currents/) is no longer in beta! Braze is proud to announce that Google Cloud Storage is available to interested customers within the Braze platform. Go to **Technology Partners** in your Braze account and search for Google Cloud Storage.
