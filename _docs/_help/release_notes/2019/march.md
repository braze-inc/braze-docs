# March 2019

## In-App Messages - Generation 3

Braze is proud to announce that we have made improvements to the look and feel of our in-app messages to adhere to the latest UX and UI best practices. In the newest in-app messages, you can expect your users to interact with messages with
- larger font sizes,
- refined spacing,
- a new close `x` asset,
- improved responsive behavior for all message types to better fit viewports of all sizes, and
- button borders to help you create custom contrasts between buttons.

Our [new in-app messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/overview/) will take your interactions with your user from good to app-mazing!

### What You Need to Do

We highly recommend updating to the latest versions of the Braze SDKs for [Web]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/initial_sdk_setup/#upgrading-the-sdk), [iOS]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/initial_sdk_setup/), and [Android]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/initial_sdk_setup/android_sdk_integration/).

After that, you're good to go!
