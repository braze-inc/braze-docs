# Twilio

{% alert warning %}
Note that support for the Twilio Webhook Integration will be discontinued on January 31, 2020. If you wish to still access SMS services with Braze, see our [SMS documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/). 
{% endalert %}

For this example, we'll configure the Braze webhook channel to send SMS and MMS to your users, via Twilio's [message sending API][20]. For your convenience, a Twilio webhook template is included on the dashboard.

## HTTP URL

The Webhook URL is provided by Twilio in your dashboard. This URL is unique to your Twilio account since it contains your Twilio account ID (`TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`).

In our Twilio example, the webhook URL is `https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID/Messages.json`. You can find this URL in the *Getting Started* section of the Twilio console.

![Twilio_Console][28]

## Request Body

The Twilio API expects the request body to be URL-encoded, so we have to start by changing the request type in the Braze webhook composer to `Raw Text`. The required parameters for the body of the request are *To*, *From*, and *Body*.

The following screenshot is an example of what your request might look like if you are sending an SMS to each user’s phone number, with the body "Hello from Braze!".

- You'll need to have valid phone numbers on each user profile in your target audience.
- To meet Twilio's request format, use the `url_param_escape` Liquid filter on your message contents. This filter encodes a string so all the characters are allowed in an HTML request; for example, the plus character (`+`) in the phone number `+12125551212` is forbidden in URL-encoded data and will be converted to `%2B12125551212`.

## Request Headers and Method

Twilio requires two request headers, the request Content-Type and an [HTTP Basic Authentication][32] header. Add them to your webhook by clicking the gear icon on beside the webhook composer, then clicking *Add New Pair* twice.

Header Name | Header Value
--- | ---
Content-Type | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
Authorization | `{% raw %}Basic {{ 'TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID:TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN' | base64_encode }}{% endraw %}`

Be sure to replace `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` with values from your Twilio dashboard. Lastly, Twilio’s API endpoint is expecting an HTTP POST request, so choose that option in the dropdown for *HTTP Method*.

## Preview Your Request

Use the webhook composer to preview the request for a random user, or for a user with particular credentials, to ensure that the request is rendering properly.
