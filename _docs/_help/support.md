Depending on your Braze permissions, and if you're a designated support contact (premium), you will either be taken to the Braze support portal where you can submit and track cases, or our standard support form. If you're unsure if you are a Braze support contact, reach out to your company's Braze administrator, Braze success manager, or account owner.

2. Either select the user name or hover over the user name row to display a menu. 
3. In the menu, select **Edit** to be redirected to the **Edit user** page.
4. Check the checkbox for **Set this user as a Designated Support Contact for Braze Support Portal**.

## Best practices for submitting a support case

### Provide as much information as possible

The more insights you can offer, the better. Include specifics like the workspace, the URL to the campaign or segment, and any relevant external IDs. This can help us troubleshoot your issue more efficiently.

### Provide a sample of users

Share a sampling of users rather than the entire affected segment. Providing a smaller amount of users helps us narrow our scope and speed up our investigations.

### Clarify expected versus actual behavior

Let us know what you were expecting and what actually happened. This can help us narrow down the possible causes of the issue.

### Attach relevant images

Consider attaching a screenshot to illustrate the problem. Providing these images can significantly aid our understanding of the issue and speed up the resolution process.

### Assess the impact

Select the appropriate severity level to help us assign the right resources to address the problem.
