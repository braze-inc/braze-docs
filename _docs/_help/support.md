Depending on your Braze permissions, and if you are a designated support contact (premium), you will either be taken to the Braze support portal where you can submit and track cases, or our standard support form. If you are unsure if you are a Braze support contact, reach out to your company's Braze administrator, Braze success manager, or account owner.
