# Troubleshooting

> If you're having trouble contributing to Braze Docs, review these common issues first. If the issue you're experiencing isn't listed, [let us know](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=issue&projects=&template=report_an_issue.md&title=) so we can add it here.

## Can't choose `braze-inc/braze-docs` as a base repository

If you're using your web browser to [make a change in GitHub]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/your_first_contribution/#step-2-make-a-change) and `braze-inc/braze-docs` is missing as an option in the **Choose a Base Repository** dropdown, then there may be a problem with your repository fork.

![The 'Choose a Base Repsitory' dropdown in GitHub after selecting 'compare across forks'.]({% image_buster /assets/img/contributing/github/choose_base_repository.png %})

First, go to the [fork you created initially]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/home/#step-3-fork-the-repository) and verify that it was forked from `braze-inc/braze-docs`. If it's showing anything other than `braze-inc/braze-docs`, you'll need to delete this fork and create a new one. 

![An example forked repository, correctly showing "fork from braze-inc/braze-docs".]()

To do this:

1. Locally back up any work that's currently only accessible on your old fork. When you delete the fork, you'll loose all work you've stored there.
2. In the old fork, go to **Settings** > **General**.
3. Under **Danger Zone**, select **Delete this repository** and follow the on-screen instructions.
    ![The list of options found in a GitHub repository's "Danger Zone".]()
4. Go back to the official [Braze Docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-docs), then select **Fork** to create a new fork.

5. Keep the default settings, then select **Create fork**.
    ![The Braze Docs GitHub repository showing "Create fork".]({% image_buster /assets/img/contributing/github/create_a_new_fork.png %})
6. Now you can try to [make your change again using GitHub]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/your_first_contribution/#step-2-make-a-change).

## Redirect isn't working

{% multi_lang_include contributing/troubleshooting/redirects.md %}

## Cross-reference link returns a 404

If a [cross-reference link]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/content_management/cross_referencing/) on your page (such as `{% raw %}[Braze Developer Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/home){% endraw %}`) returns a 404 page, check the URL for the following string.

```plaintext
%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7D
```

A URL containing this string will be similar to the following:

```plaintext
https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/connected_content/%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7D/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/message_activity_log_tab
```

If you find this string in the URL, one or more of your cross-reference links are surrounded in [Liquid raw tags](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/tags/raw).

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Liquid raw tag %}
<code>
&#123;% raw %} &#123;% endraw %}
</code>
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Move these tags so that they're only surrounding the Liquid content you want to display as raw.

{% tabs local %}
{% tab before %}
<code>
&#123;% raw %} Learn how to use Liquid's <code>&#123;&#123; page_title }} tag. For more information, see [Liquid tags](&#123;&#123;site.baseurl}}/contributing/liquid/). &#123;% endraw %}
</code>
{% endtab %}

{% tab after %}
<code>
Learn how to use Liquid's &#123;% raw %} &#123;&#123; page_title }} &#123;% endraw %} tag. For more information, see [Liquid tags](&#123;&#123;site.baseurl}}/contributing/liquid/).
</code>
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Conflict: Destination is shared by multiple files

If `rake` throws the following warning, this means that two or more files are sharing the same [`permalink` YAML value]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/yaml_front_matter/metadata/#permalink).

```bash
Conflict: The following destination is shared by multiple files.
                    The written file may end up with unexpected contents.
                    /Users/USERNAME/braze-docs/_site/api_usage/index.html
                     - /Users/USERNAME/braze-docs/_docs/_developer_guide/platforms/android.md
                     - /Users/USERNAME/braze-docs/_docs/_developer_guide/platforms/firos.md
```

{% alert note %}
Although the warning appears after running `rake`, it's actually generated by Jekyll, our static-site generator. For more information, refer to [Jekyll GitHub: Issue #8522](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8522).
{% endalert %}

To fix this, change the `permalink` value of one of the files, so they're no longer set to the same URL. For example:

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Before %}
In `_docs/_developer_guide/platforms/android.md`:
```markdown
---
nav_title: Android
permalink: /docs/developer_guide/best_sdk
---

# The Android Braze SDK

> Get started with the Braze Android SDK!
```

In `_docs/_developer_guide/platforms/fireos.md`:
```markdown
---
nav_title: FireOS
permalink: /docs/developer_guide/best_sdk
---

# The FireOS Braze SDK

> Get started with the Braze Android SDK!
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab After %}
In `_docs/_developer_guide/platforms/android.md`:
```markdown
---
nav_title: Android
permalink: /docs/developer_guide/best_sdk
---

# The Android Braze SDK

> Get started with the Braze Android SDK!
```

In `_docs/_developer_guide/platforms/fireos.md`:
```markdown
---
nav_title: FireOS
permalink: /docs/developer_guide/second_best_sdk
---

# The FireOS Braze SDK

> Get started with the Braze Android SDK!
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
