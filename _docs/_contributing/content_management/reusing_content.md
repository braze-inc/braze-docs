# Reusing content with includes

> Learn how to reuse content with includes across Braze Docs, so you can improve content consistency and reduce the time for content creation. For general information about content reuse, see [About content management]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/content_management/#content-reuse).

Content reuse in Jekyll is accomplished using includes. Includes are stored in the `_includes` directory as a regular Markdown file. Although, unlike the Markdown files in the `_docs` directory, these files don't need YAML front matter.

{% multi_lang_include contributing/prerequisites.md %}

## Creating an include

Create a new Markdown file with a `.md` extension in the `_includes` directory. While include files can be stored anywhere in this directory, it's best to keep related content together using subdirectories. Your file tree should like similar to the following:

```bash
braze-docs
└── _includes
    ├── alerts
    ├── archive
    └── contributing
        └── site_generator.md
```

Add content to your page, and be sure to follow the [Braze Docs Style Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/style_guide/). If you plan on adding your include to a page that already has YAML front matter, do not add front matter to your include. Your content should be similar to the following:

{% raw %}
```markdown
## Site generator 

Braze Docs is built using Jekyll, a popular static-site generator (SSG) that allows content files and design files to be stored in separate directories, such as `_docs` for content files and `assets` for design files. When the site is built, Jekyll intelligently merges each file and stores them as XML and HTML data in the `_site` directory. For more information, see [Jekyll Directory Structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/).

As a contributor, you'll primarily work within the following directories.

| Directory                                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`_docs`](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-docs/tree/develop/_docs)         | Contains all the written content for Braze Docs as text files written in Markdown. Text files are organized into directories and subdirectories mirroring the docs site, such as `_api` for the [API section]({{site.baseurl}}/api/home) and `user_guide` for the [User Guide section]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/introduction). |
| [`_includes`](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-docs/tree/develop/_includes) | Contains text files (called "includes") that can be reused in any file within the `_docs` directory. Typically, includes are short, modular pieces of content that don't use standard formatting. The files stored in this location are important for [content reuse](#content-reuse).                                            |
| [`assets`](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-docs/tree/develop/assets)       | Contains all the images for Braze Docs. Any text file in the `_docs` or `_includes` directory can link to this directory to display an image on its page.                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Referencing an include

To reference an include, use the following syntax within the relevant Markdown file:

{% raw %}
```plaintext
{% multi_lang_include PATH_TO_INCLUDE %}
```
{% endraw %}

Replace `PATH_TO_INCLUDE` with the relative path from inside the `_includes` directory. For example, given the following file tree:

```bash
braze-docs
└── _includes
    ├── alerts
    ├── archive
    └── contributing
        └── prerequisites.md
```

The reference would be similar to the following:

{% tabs local %}
{% tab example input %}
{% raw %}
```markdown

{% multi_lang_include contributing/prerequisites.md %}
```
{% endraw %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab example output %}
![Content reuse example on Braze Docs.]({% image_buster /assets/img/contributing/styling_examples/includes.png %}){: style="max-width:90%;"}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
