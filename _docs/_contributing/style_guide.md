# Braze Docs style guide

> Refer to the following general guidelines when contributing to Braze Docs.

## Voice and tone

The Braze brand voice is smart, conversational, and direct. We are a human voice in a world of tech buzzwords; we provide clarity and guidance to anyone interested in the craft of customer engagement; and we eschew jargon in favor of concise language that is as easy to understand as it is powerful.

To align on this brand voice in our writing and editing, we use three voice guidelines: straightforward, empowering, and human.

### Straightforward

Clearly structure your writing and make it easy for people to find the information they need.

- Explain complicated things simply.
- Be concise.
- Use consistent language for features and actions.

| Guideline | Example |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ Use visuals to help clarify complex subjects. | The user profile lifecycle image in the [User profile lifecycle]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data/unification/user_data_collection/user_profile_lifecycle/) article helps to illustrate a tricky concept. |
| ✅ Create a clear information hierarchy. | "This is an overview for how content is managed on Braze Docs. To learn more about a specific topic, choose the dedicated topic page in the navigation." |
| ✅ Ruthlessly cut jargon and acronyms if possible. If not possible, define them. | "The Short Messaging Service (SMS) is used to send and receive brief text messages." |

### Empowering

What problem are you trying to solve with your writing? Keep that problem in mind while creating any content.

-Explain the “why” and “how” to give users the confidence to take action.
-Be specific when explaining benefits, and be clear about what is and isn’t possible.
- Offer practical advice and sincere encouragement.

| Guideline | Example |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ Make it easy to find the happy path. | "When you stop a Canvas, the following applies: 1. Users will be prevented from entering the Canvas. 2. No further messages will be sent out, despite where a user is in the flow.  3. **Exception:** Email Canvases won't immediately stop." |
| ✅ Provide examples, use cases, and templates that simplify or elevate the user’s work. | "`IInAppMessageManagerListener` also includes delegate methods for clicks on the message itself or one of the buttons. A common use case would be intercepting a message when a button or message is clicked for further processing." |

### Human

Informational writing is inherently dry—we want readers to focus on the content, not the delivery. We can still write in a way that will help our readers process the information they’re consuming and make it more likely that they’ll internalize the knowledge. Be human, let your personality show, and be memorable.

- Aim for a conversational tone rather than a formal one.
- Focus on the user; respect their situation and emotional state.
- Actively center the human experience, not the machine state.

| Guideline | Example |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ Thoughtfully apply brand tone and assets. | "Integrating with Braze is a worthwhile process. But you’re smart. You're here. Clearly, you already know that." |
| ✅ Apply accessibility best practices for both visual and verbal content. | Replacing idioms like "out-of-the-box" with "default" make your text more accessible to English second language speakers. |
| ✅ Provide consistent support across the user journey. | Use the Diátaxis framework to ensure you’re meeting the needs of different users at different times. |

## Accessibility

Braze aims to provide an inclusive experience. Use the following guidelines to ensure your learning content is accessible to the 1 billion people with an accessibility need.

### General

- Avoid biased or ableist language. For more information, see the section on [Inclusive language].
- Use a [screen reader](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/get-started-mh35884/mac) to test your content.
- Don’t use an ampersand (&) in place of "and" unless referencing UI elements that use an ampersand.

### Language and formatting

- Use plain language.
- Front-load sections with the most important information. Use the journalism model of the inverted pyramid.
- Break up walls of text to help readers scan for information. Use paragraphs, lists, callouts, and images to improve readability.
- Write short sentences and paragraphs. As a general rule, aim for no more than 20 words per sentence, five sentences per paragraph.
- Avoid using Latin acronyms and phrases, as they can be hard to translate. Instead, use simple words or phrases.

### Headings

- Use unique, descriptive, and clear headings and titles.
- Use an H1 for page titles.
- Don’t skip heading levels. An H3 should follow an H2, and so on.

### Links

- Don’t use link text like “Learn more”, “here”, or “this document”. For more phrases to avoid, refer to the section Writing Links.
- Avoid placing two links back to back in a sentence. Put a character or word in between to separate them.
- Links to download files should indicate clicking the link will download the file, as well as the file type (such as PDF or CSV).
- If it isn’t clear from the context, links to sections in the same document should use a standard phrase indicating this action.
