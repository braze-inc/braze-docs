# Formatting and organization 

## Addresses

Use the numeral followed by the street name like so:

330 W. 34th St.

To display a full address, use the numeral, followed by the street name, followed by the city, state, and zip code. There’s no need for a comma between the state and zip code.

330 W. 34th St., New York, NY 10001

## Button labels

Button labels should be clear and predictable—the user should know what action will occur upon clicking the button. Use sentence case for button labels, and lead with a strong verb. If it may be unclear what the verb is referring to, use the format [verb] + [noun].

Omit unnecessary words and articles, such as “a”, “an,” or “the”.
