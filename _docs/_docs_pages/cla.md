# CONTRIBUTION LICENSE AGREEMENT

This Contribution License Agreement (this "Agreement"), effective as of the last date beneath the parties’ signature below (the "Effective Date"), is entered into by Braze, Inc., a Delaware corporation having its principal place of business at 330 W 34th St, New York, NY 10001 ("Braze"), and the party signing below ("You").

In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

1. Definitions.
  * "Project" means any of the projects owned or managed by Braze in which documentation is made available under an Open Source Initiative or a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses).
  * "Submit" is the act of uploading, submitting, transmitting, or distributing content to any Project, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of discussing and improving that Project.
  * "Submission" means any other copyrightable material Submitted by You, including any associated comments and documentation but excluding material that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Submission."<br><br>

2. Your Submission. You must agree to the terms of this Agreement before making a Submission to any Project. This Agreement covers any and all Submissions that You, now or in the future (except as described in Section 4 below), Submit to any Project.<br><br>

3. Originality of Work. You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work. Should You wish to Submit materials that are not Your original work, You may Submit them separately to the Project if (a) You retain all copyright and license information that was in the materials as You received them, (b) in the description accompanying Your Submission, You include the phrase "Submission containing materials of a third party:" followed by the names of the third party and any licenses or other restrictions of which You are aware, and (c) You follow any other instructions in the Project’s written guidelines concerning Submissions.<br><br>

4. Your Employer. References to "employer" in this Agreement include Your employer or anyone else for whom You are acting in making Your Submission, e.g., as a contractor, vendor, or agent. If Your Submission is made in the course of Your work for an employer or Your employer has intellectual property rights in Your Submission by contract or applicable law, You must secure permission from Your employer to make the Submission before signing this Agreement. In that case, the term "You" in this Agreement will refer to You and the employer collectively. If You change employers in the future and desire to Submit additional Submissions for the new employer, then You agree to sign a new Agreement and secure permission from the new employer before Submitting those Submissions.<br><br>

5. Licenses.
a. Copyright License. You grant Braze, and those who receive the Submission directly or indirectly from Braze, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license in the Submission to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute the Submission and such derivative works, and to sublicense any or all of the foregoing rights to third parties.
b. Other Rights Reserved. Each party reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement. No additional licenses or rights whatsoever (including, without limitation, any implied licenses) are granted by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise.<br><br>

6. Representations and Warranties. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work (except as You may have disclosed as required pursuant to Section 3). You represent that You have secured permission from Your employer to make the Submission in cases where Your Submission is made in the course of Your work for Your employer or Your employer has intellectual property rights in Your Submission by contract or applicable law. If You are signing this Agreement on behalf of Your employer, You represent and warrant that You have the necessary authority to bind the listed employer to the obligations contained in this Agreement. You are not expected to provide support for Your Submission, unless You choose to do so. UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, AND EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTIONS 3, 4, AND 6, THE SUBMISSION PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br><br>

7. Notice to Braze. You agree to notify Braze in writing of any facts or circumstances of which You later become aware that would make any of Your representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.<br><br>

8. Information about Submissions. You agree that contributions to Projects and information about contributions may be maintained indefinitely and disclosed publicly, including Your name and other information that You Submit with Your Submission.<br><br>

9. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed exclusively by the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules. The state and federal courts located in the State of New York, District of Manhattan, New York City, shall have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each party consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. Each party also waives any right to jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to this Agreement. <br><br>

10. Entire Agreement/Assignment. This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties regarding Your Submission of any materials to any Project, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter.  This Agreement may be assigned by Braze. <br><br>

Select one of the options below and sign as indicated. By signing, You accept and agree to the terms of this Contribution License Agreement for Your present and future Submissions to Braze.
