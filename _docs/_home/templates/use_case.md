# Use Case Name

> Welcome to the Use Case Template! Here, you'll find everything you need to write a walk through of a Braze Use Case. In this first section, you should describe the use case in just a few sentences. Perhaps something like "this use case explores how you can reintroduce lapsing users to your content using Push, Email, etc.".
>
> This is where you set up the Use Case Scenario. Why would someone want to read this page? Present a gripping hypothetical to "get the reader in the mood". Perhaps... "Sally's company, a hypothetical makeup company, finds that a portion of their users have shown little to no interest in their app app, even though they open their emails. They don't click on anything, but they open them! Sally decided that they wanted to convert 20% of these people to be app users again"
>
> The goals of this use case are as follows (break down the preceding scenario):
> - Goal 1
> - Goal 2
> - Goal 3

## Suggested Metrics

It's time to talk about measurement! How should the Braze User look to measure their campaign? What conversion metrics should they set up? List them in the following chart.

| Metric | Description | Data Type |
| ------ | ----------- | --------- |
| Conversion 1 | This is a conversion. You should measure it because "reasons". | Boolean. |
| Conversion 2 | This is another conversion. You should measure it because "reasons". | Boolean. |
| Age | This is a user attribute. You should measure it because "reasons". | Integer. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3}

## How to Build This Campaign/Canvas

When you write this portion of the article, break down what they should be doing by Strategy and Step. You can make this obvious by naming the steps as follows. Don't explicitly write out the Steps (i.e., Click this button; click that button). Instead, instruct and guide them by describing steps that accomplish goals of the Use Case.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Canvas for Lapsing Users (Advise on Audience)

When you talk about Audience, you don't need to instruct them on how to use Segments or Filters. Instead, guide them on how to narrow their audience to Lapsing Users and ensuring it doesn't go to anyone else and why that's important. Something like "you can approach narrowing your lapsing users in a few ways - like selecting users who haven't used the app in a few days, or opened an email if that's what you want. Make sure you apply a filter if you want to exclude anyone who has been away from the app for so long they might not be worth the data points."

### Step 2: Send Your Message at the Right Time

Talk about when to send your message, if that's important. It might not be! At least let them know that sending in local time is a thing. Or let them know how to API trigger this specific situation, or even if you're using a Canvas and it's better to trigger the step based on an action (like opening an email and not clicking for at least a day after).

### Step 3: Building Your Message

This is where you can advise on best practices. Highly recommend doing this, even if you just list some things. I would also add in some images.

### Step 4: Anything Else

If you need to add on an addition step, like talking about wait steps or something like that in a Canvas, I would continue that here and in subsequent steps. Don't make the article too long, though - you don't want to lose the audience.
