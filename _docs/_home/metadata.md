# Docs Metadata

> This article walks through the options for adding metadata to Docs pages. We optimize our search based on page type and other bits of metadata, including: [yaml tags](#yaml-tags) and [page types](#page-types) (based on [templates]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/)).

{% alert important %}

The [content tags](#content-tags) listed on this page are currently a work in progress and cannot be applied to pages without causing errors. Check back later for the final version, when these can be safely applied! Note that you **can** currently use the `platform` content tag.

{% endalert %}

## YAML Tags

These are independent. If you need to see additional optional YAML content based on "Layout", check out the [templates]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/) and layouts (TBD) breakdowns.

{% alert important %}
A note on capitalization... 
<br> 
<br> 
Leave all tag values (except for the content for the `description` tag) lowercase. This will ensure consistency. We may change this in the future, but for now, lowercase is better and easier to mass search and replace in the event of a formatting update.
{% endalert %}

### Configuration Tags

These will automatically change the layout or function of a page.

| YAML Content Tag | Description | Required? | Data Type | Available Values |
| ----------------- | ----------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| `nav_title` | This is the title of the article that will appear in the left navigation of the Docs site. Encapsulate in quotes. | Yes, unless page is `hidden`. | String. | Any - the title of a page is up to you. We recommend less than 30 characters with spaces. |
| `page_order` | This is the order in which the article will appear in the left navigation of the Docs site. | Yes, unless page is hidden. | Integer. | Any number (including multiple decimals) between `1` and `100`. You can use `1.1`, `1.2`, `1.3`, etc. to order pages, as well.|
| `hidden` | Notes whether or not the page will be visible in the left navigation bar. Setting this to `false` will cause the page not to appear in searches (both on-site or through online search providers). | No. | Boolean. | You may choose between `true` and `false`. |
| `config_only` | Whether or not a page will act as a page or as a category in the left navigation panel. Defaults to `false`. | No. |  Boolean. | You may choose between `true` and `false`. |
| `permalink` | Sets the page's url. For example: `permalink: /this_page_name/` will set the page's URL to `https://www.braze.com/docs/this_page_name/`. | No, unless page is `hidden`. | String. | Any - this URL is up to you. Encapsulate in slashes (`/`). |
| `layout` | Sets specific features on the page that align with developed layouts. Defaults is a regular page. | No. | String. | If you do not set this, it will default to a regular content page. You may choose between: `api_page`, `dev_guide`, `featured_video`, `featured`, `glossary_page`, `blank_config`, and `redirect`. There are others, but those are mostly for internal and config uses. |
| `hide_toc` | Determines whether the Table of Contents on the right side of the page is included or not. | No. | Boolean. | You may choose between `true` and `false`. |
| `noindex` | Determines whether the article will show in Algolia and Google Searches. Defaults to `false` unless you have the `hidden` YAML tag set as `true`. | No. | Boolean. | `true` or `false`. |

### Content Tags
These will assist in external and internal SEO, informing page content and formatting, and other content-based structure.

| YAML Content Tag | Description  | Required? | Exclusive or can multiple be used? | Data Type | Available Values |
| ----------------- | ----------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| `description` | Description of the page that will show in online searches. Encapsulate in quotes. | Yes. | Exclusive up to 160 characters. | String. | Any - the page description of a page is up to you. We recommend less than 3 sentences. <br> <br> Template: `This {page_type} {lists, describes, walks you through} {topic or task} for {platform and/or channel} using {tool}.` Though the exact phrasing can vary, it must include at least the page type, what the page aims to do (as in, it will "walk you through how to perform noted task" or "teach you how to read a certain report" or "describe the requirements of a certain Partner integration". <br> <br> Example: `This glossary lists all of the terms you need to know while onboarding with Braze and preparing for the Integration Phase.` Or `This reference article describes the different kinds of Canvas Steps and how they affect iOS or Android push campaigns.` Or even `This solutions article will walk you through a custom integration.` |
| `page_type` | Type of page, determined by page templates. Inform formatting and content. | Yes. | Exclusive; only one can be used per page. | String. | See [Page Types](#page-types). |
| `platform` | Notes which platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) the article is associated with. | No, unless on a Dev Guide page.  | Multiple values can be used. | String. | Any of the platforms Braze integrates on: `iOS`, `Android`, `Web`, `API`, and any of the wrapper SDKs. |
| `channel` | Notes which messaging channels (push, in-app messages, etc.) the article is associated with. | No, unless the content mentions a specific channel or channels. | Multiple values can be used. | String. | Any of the messaging channels Braze sends to: `content cards`, `email`, `news feed`, `in-app messages`, `push`, `sms`, and `webhooks`.|
| `tool` | Notes which engagement tools (Canvas, campaigns, etc.) the article is associated with. | Yes. | Multiple values can be used. | String. | Any of Braze's  tools: `dashboard`, `docs`, `canvas`, `campaigns`, `segments`, `templates`, `media`, `location`, `currents`, `reports`. |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3  .reset-td-br-4}

### Multiple Tag Values
Sometimes, you may find that a content tag for a page could be categorized with multiple values (as in, an article might talk about both Canvas and campaigns, or cover a custom integration for both Android and iOS).

You can format that like this: 
```
key:
  - string1
  - string2      
  - string3
  - string4
  - string5
  - string6
```
{% alert important %}
Note that there can only be a single `page_type` value for page. A page cannot be both a `reference` and a `glossary`. The different page types exist to narrow the scope and purpose of each article. 
{% endalert %}

### Sample YAML

The top of every markdown page should begin with a section of yaml to define the page.

```html
---
nav_title: "Docs Metadata"
page_order: 0

description: "This page walks through the options for adding metadata to Docs pages. We optimize our search based on page type and other bits of metadata. This is a great resource for contributors via our GitHub page."
page_type: reference
tool:

```


## Page Types

To apply these, be sure your yaml parameter for page types is: `page_type:`

For example: `page_type: glossary`

| Page Type <br> <br> Page Type Tag | Description | Available Templates |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Glossary Page <br> <br> `glossary`| Page provides a searchable description of certain terms or elements (metrics, words to know, API Endpoints, etc.) | [API or Code Glossary]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/api_glossary/) <br> <br> [General Glossary]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/glossary_test_page/)
| Solution Page <br> <br> `solution` | A troubleshooting or "options" article that walks users through a solution to an issue or through steps to resolving or narrowing down an issue. | [Help Article]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/help_article_template/) <br> <br> [Solution Article]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/solution/) |
| Reference Page <br> <br> `reference` | An article that explains a concept and contains specific information about technical processes and product content. (Canvas Steps, Segmentation, specific Product Features etc.). | [Reference Article with Video]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/reference_vide/) <br> <br> [Reference Article]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/reference/) |
| Tutorial Page <br> <br> `tutorial` | A general walkthrough of an instructional concept. Should contain practical knowledge. Focuses on a single topic (like, how to create a campaign, how to create a canvas, etc.) Goal or Task-Oriented Article that walks step-by-step through solving a specific issue (How to target specific users, how to segment based on location, etc.). | [Tutorial Article with Video]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/tutorial_video/) <br> <br> [Tutorial Article]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/tutorial/) <br> <br> [Use Case Article with Video]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/use_case_video/) <br> <br> [Use Case Article]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/use_case/) |
| Landing Page <br> <br> `landing` | Page provides a selection of options within a certain section, as well as a description or overview of said section. | [Single Section Landing Page using FA Icons]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/landing_single/) <br> <br> [Single Section Landing Page using Images]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/landing_images/) <br> <br> [Multi-Section Landing Page using FA Icons]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/landing_multiple/) <br> <br> [Multi-Section Landing Page using Images]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/landing_multiple_images/)
| Partner Page <br> <br> `partner` | A page that combines many of the preceding page types into a single page. These pages describe a partner, the benefits of that partner, how to integrate that partner, then how to use that integration and any best practices associated with that usage. | [Partner Page with Video]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/partner_page_template_video/) <br> <br> [Partner Page]({{site.baseurl}}/home/templates/partner_page_template/) |
| Updates and Release Notes <br> <br> `update` | A page that lists updates to a product or SDK in succession. A single update on a larger page or a page about a new feature would **not** count as an `update` page type. | See Release Notes Pages and SDK Changelogs pages. |
