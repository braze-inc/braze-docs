  "message_variation_id": (optional, string) used when providing a campaign_id to specify which message variation this message should be tracked under,
  "extras": (optional, valid Key-Value Hash), extra hash - for SendGrid customers, this will be passed to SendGrid as Unique Arguments,
  "headers": (optional, valid Key-Value Hash), hash of custom extensions headers. Currently, only supported for SendGrid customers,
  "should_inline_css": (optional, boolean), whether to inline CSS on the body. If not provided, falls back to the default CSS inlining value for the App Group,
  "attachments": (optional, array), array of JSON objects that define the files you need attached, defined by "file_name" and "url" below,
    "file_name": (required, string) the name of the file you would like to attach to your email. You can attach any number of files up to 2MB. This is required if you use "attachments",
    "url": (required, string) the corresponding URL of the file you would like to attach to your email. The file name's extension will be detected automatically from the URL defined below, which should return the appropriate "Content-Type" as a response header. This is required if you use "attachments".
}

An `email_template_id` can be retrieved from the bottom of any Email Template created within the dashboard. Below is an example of what this ID looks like:
