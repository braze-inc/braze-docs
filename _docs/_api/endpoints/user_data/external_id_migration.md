guide_top_text: "The External ID Migration API allows you to rename existing external IDs (creating a new primary ID and deprecating the existing ID) and remove deprecated IDs post-migration. <br><br> We've architected this solution to allow multiple External IDs in order to support a migration period whereby older versions of your apps still in the wild that use the previous External ID naming schema donâ€™t break. We highly recommend removing deprecated External IDs once your old naming schema is no longer in use."
