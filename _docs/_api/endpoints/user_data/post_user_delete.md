> Use this endpoint to delete any user profile by specifying a known user identifier.

Up to 50 `external_ids`, `user_aliases`, `braze_ids`, `email_addresses`, or `phone_numbers` can be included in a single request. Only one of `external_ids`, `user_aliases`, `braze_ids`, `email_addresses`, or `phone_numbers` can be included in a single request. 

If you have a use case that can't be solved with bulk user deletion through the API, contact the [Braze Support team]({{site.baseurl}}/help/support/) for assistance.

### Deleting users by email

If an `email` is specified as an identifier, an additional `prioritization` value is required in the identifier. The `prioritization` is an ordered array and should specify which user to delete if multiple users are found. This means deleting users will not occur if more than one user matches a prioritization.

The allowed values for the array are: `identified`, `unidentified`, `most_recently_updated`. `most_recently_updated` refers to prioritizing the most recently updated user.

Only one of the following options may exist in the prioritization array at a time:

- `identified` refers to prioritizing a user with an `external_id`
- `unidentified` refers to prioritizing a user without an `external_id`
