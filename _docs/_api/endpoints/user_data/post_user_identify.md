# Identify users
{% apimethod post %}
/users/identify
{% endapimethod %}

> Use this endpoint to identify an unidentified (alias-only or email-only) user using the provided external ID.

{% apiref postman %}https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4689407/SVYrsdsG?version=latest#5f74e0f7-0620-4c7b-b0a2-f5f38fdbff58 {% endapiref %}

## How it works

Calling `/users/identify` combines a user profile that is identified by an alias (alias-only profile) or email address (email-only profile) with a user profile that has an `external_id` (identified profile), then removes the alias-only profile. 

Identifying a user requires an `external_id` to be included in the `aliases_to_identify` or `emails_to_identify` object. If there isn't a user with that `external_id`, the `external_id` will be added to the aliased user's record, and the user will be considered identified.

Note the following:

- When these subsequent associations are made with the `merge_behavior` field set to `none`, only the push tokens and message history associated with the user alias are retained; any attributes, events, or purchases will be "orphaned" and not available on the identified user. One workaround is to export the aliased user's data before identification using the [`/users/export/ids` endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/export/user_data/post_users_identifier/), then re-associate the attributes, events, and purchases with the identified user.
- When associations are made with the `merge_behavior` field set to `merge`, this endpoint will merge [specific fields](#merge) found on the anonymous user to the identified user.

{% alert tip %}
To prevent unexpected loss of data when identifying users, we highly recommend that you first refer to [data collection best practices]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/user_data_collection/best_practices/#capturing-user-data-when-alias-only-user-info-is-already-present) to learn about capturing user data when alias-only user information is already present.
{% endalert %}

## Prerequisites

To use this endpoint, you'll need an [API key]({{site.baseurl}}/api/api_key/) with the `users.identify` permission.

## Rate limit

## Request body

```
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_REST_API_KEY
```

```json

   "aliases_to_identify" : (required, array of alias to identify objects),

   "merge_behavior": (optional, string) one of 'none' or 'merge' is expected
}
```

### Request parameters

You can add up to 50 user aliases per request. You can associate multiple additional user aliases with a single `external_id`.

| Parameter             | Required | Data Type                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|----------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `aliases_to_identify` | Required | Array of aliases to identify object | See [alias to identify object]({{site.baseurl}}/api/objects_filters/aliases_to_identify/) and [user alias object]({{site.baseurl}}/api/objects_filters/user_alias_object/). |
| `emails_to_identify`  | Required | Array of aliases to identify object | See [Identifying users by email](#identifying-users-by-email).                                                                                                              |
| `merge_behavior`      | Optional | String                              | One of `none` or `merge` is expected. Defaults to `merge`.                                                                                                                                        |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3  .reset-td-br-4 role="presentation" }

#### Merge_behavior field {#merge}

Setting the `merge_behavior` field to `merge` sets the endpoint to merge the following list of fields found **exclusively** on the anonymous user to the identified user. Setting the field to `none` will not merge any user data to the identified user profile. By default, this field will set to `merge`.

{% details List of fields that are merged %}
- First name
- Last name
- Email
- Gender
- Date of birth
- Phone number
- Time zone
- Home city
- Country
- Language
- Session count (the sum of sessions from both profiles)
- Date of first session (Braze will pick the earlier date of the two dates)
- Date of last session (Braze will pick the later date of the two dates)
- Custom attributes
- Custom event and purchase event data
- Custom event and purchase event properties for "X times in Y days" segmentation (where X<=50 and Y<=30)
- Segmentable custom events summary
  - Event count (the sum from both profiles)
  - Event first occurred (Braze will pick the earlier date of the two dates)
  - Event last occurred (Braze will pick the later date of the two dates)
- In-app purchase total in cents (the sum from both profiles)
- Total number of purchases (the sum from both profiles)
- Date of first purchase (Braze will pick the earlier date of the two dates)
- Date of last purchase (Braze will pick the later date of the two dates)
- App summaries
- Last_X_at fields (Braze will update the fields if the orphaned profile fields are more recent)
- Campaign summaries (Braze will pick the most recent date fields)
- Workflow summaries (Braze will pick the most recent date fields)
- Message and message engagement history
- Custom event and purchase event count and first date and last date timestamps 
  - These merged fields will update "for X events in Y days" filters. For purchase events, these filters include "number of purchases in Y days" and "money spent in last Y days".
- Session data if the app exists on both user profiles
  - For example, if our target user doesn't have an app summary for "ABCApp" but our original user does, the target user will have the "ABCApp" app summary on their profile after the merge.

### Identifying users by email

If an `email` is specified as an identifier, an additional `prioritization` value is required in the identifier. The `prioritization` should be an array specifying which user to merge if there are multiple users found. `prioritization` is an ordered array, meaning if more than one user matches from a prioritization, then merging will not occur.

The allowed values for the array are: `identified`, `unidentified`, `most_recently_updated`. `most_recently_updated` refers to prioritizing the most recently updated user.

Only one of the following options may exist in the prioritization array at a time:
- `identified` refers to prioritizing a user with an `external_id`
- `unidentified` refers to prioritizing a user without an `external_id`
