guide_top_header: "User Data Endpoints"
guide_top_text: "The User API allows you to track information on your users by logging data about your users that comes from outside your mobile app. You can also use this API to delete users for testing or other purposes. <br> <br> All API endpoints have a data payload limit of 4MB. Attempts to post more data than 4MB will fail with an HTTP 413 Request Entity Too Large. <br> <br> The following examples contain the URL https://rest.iad-01.braze.com, but some customers will need to use a different endpoint URL, for example if you are hosted in Braze's EU data center or have a dedicated Braze installation. Your Success Manager will inform you if you should use a different endpoint URL."
