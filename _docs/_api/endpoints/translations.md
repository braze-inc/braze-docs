# How our translation endpoints work

Braze Translation endpoints work with multi-language composition, where a message can have different versions that can be rendered depending on the user receiving the message.

## Prerequisites

Before using these endpoints, you must add your locales.

### Step 1: Go to multi-language settings

### Step 2: Create a message

### Step 3: Add translation tags in your message

### Step 4: Copy IDs for API use
