## Troubleshooting

The following table lists possible returned errors and their associated troubleshooting steps.

| Error | Troubleshooting |
| --- | --- |
| `Content Block ID cannot be blank` | Make sure that a Content Block is listed in your request and is encapsulated in quotes (`""`). |
| `Content Block ID is invalid for this workspace` | This Content Block doesn't exist or is in a different company account or workspace. |
| `Content Block has been deleted—content not available` | This Content Block, though it may have existed earlier, has been deleted. |
| `Include Inclusion Data—error` | This parameter only accepts boolean values (true or false). Make sure the value for `include_inclusion_data` is not encapsulated in quotes (`""`), which causes the value to be sent as a string instead. See [request parameters](#request-parameters) for details. |
