# Canvas list endpoint
{% apimethod get %}
/canvas/list
{% endapimethod %}

This endpoint allows you to export a list of Canvases, including the name, Canvas API Identifier and associated Tags. The Canvases are returned in groups of 100 sorted by time of creation (oldest to newest by default).

Archived Canvases will not be included in the API response unless the `include_archived` field is specified. Canvases that are stopped but not archived, however, will be returned by default.
