# Send Analytics Endpoint
{% apimethod get %}
/sends/data_series
{% endapimethod %}

This endpoint allows you to retrieve a daily series of various stats for a tracked `send_id`. Braze stores send analytics for 14 days after the send.

Campaign conversions will be attributed towards the most recent send id that a given user has received from the campaign.
