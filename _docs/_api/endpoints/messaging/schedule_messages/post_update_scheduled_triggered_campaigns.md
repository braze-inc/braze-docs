# Update scheduled API-triggered campaigns
{% apimethod post core_endpoint|https://www.braze.com/docs/core_endpoints %}
/campaigns/trigger/schedule/update
{% endapimethod %}

> Use this endpoint to update scheduled API-triggered campaigns created in the dashboard, allowing you to decide what action should trigger the message to be sent.

You can pass in `trigger_properties` that will be templated into the message itself.

Note that to send messages with this endpoint, you must have a campaign ID, created when you build an [API-Triggered Campaign]({{site.baseurl}}/api/api_campaigns/).

Any schedule will completely overwrite the one you provided in the create schedule request or previous update schedule requests. For example, if you originally set the schedule to `"schedule" : {"time" : "2015-02-20T13:14:47", "in_local_time" : true}` and then later update it to `"schedule" : {"time" : "2015-02-20T14:14:47"}`, the message will now be sent at the specified time in UTC, not in the user's local time.

Scheduled triggers that are updated very close to or during the time they were supposed to be sent will be updated with best efforts so that last-second changes can be applied to all, some, or none of your targeted users. Updates aren't applied if the original schedule used local time and the original time has already passed in any time zone.
