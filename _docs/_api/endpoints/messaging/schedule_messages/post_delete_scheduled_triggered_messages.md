# Delete scheduled API-triggered campaigns
{% apimethod post core_endpoint|https://www.braze.com/docs/core_endpoints %} 
/campaigns/trigger/schedule/delete
{% endapimethod %}

The delete schedule endpoint allows you to cancel a message that you previously scheduled API-triggered campaigns before it has been sent.

{% apiref postman %}https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4689407/SVYrsdsG?version=latest#7d34037f-4bf2-4fab-bc9c-c972988051a7 {% endapiref %}

## Rate limit

{% include rate_limits.md endpoint='default' %}

## Request body

Scheduled messages or triggers that are deleted very close to or during the time they were supposed to be sent will be updated with best efforts, so last-second deletions could be applied to all, some, or none of your targeted users.
