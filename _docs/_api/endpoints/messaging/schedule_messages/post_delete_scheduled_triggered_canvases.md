/canvas/trigger/schedule/delete
{% endapimethod %}

The delete schedule endpoint allows you to cancel a message that you previously scheduled API-triggered Canvases before it has been sent.

{% apiref postman %}https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4689407/SVYrsdsG?version=latest#7d34037f-4bf2-4fab-bc9c-c972988051a7 {% endapiref %}

## Rate limit

{% include rate_limits.md endpoint='default' %}
