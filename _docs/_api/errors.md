# API errors and responses

> This reference article covers the various errors and server responses that can come up while using the Braze API and how to troubleshoot them. 

{% raw %}

## Server responses

If your POST payload was accepted by our servers, then successful messages will be met with the following response:

```json
{
  "message" : "success"
}
```

Note that success only means that the RESTful API payload was correctly formed and passed onto our push notification or email or other messaging services. It does not mean that the messages were actually delivered, as additional factors could prevent the message from being delivered (e.g., a device could be offline, the push token could be rejected by Apple's servers, you may have provided an unknown user ID, etc.)

If your message is successful but has non-fatal errors you will receive the following response:

```json
{
  "message" : "success", "errors" : [<minor error message>]
}
```

In the case of a success, any messages that were not affected by an error in the `errors` array will still be delivered. If your message has a fatal error you will receive the following response:

```json
{
  "message" : <fatal error message>, "errors" : [<minor error message>]
}
```

## Queued responses {#messaging-queued}

During times of maintenance, Braze might pause real-time processing of the API. In these situations, the server will return an `HTTP Accepted 202` response code and the following body, which indicates that we have received and queued the API call but have not immediately processed it. All scheduled maintenance will be posted to the [Braze System Status](http://status.braze.com) page ahead of time.

```json
{
  "message" : "queued"
}
```

## Responses for tracked send IDs

Analytics are always available for campaigns. In addition, analytics are available for a specific campaign send instance when the campaign is sent as a broadcast. When tracking is available for a specific campaign send instance, you will receive the following response:

```json
{
  "message": "success", "send_id" : "example_send_id"
}
```

The provided send id can be used as a parameter for the send/data_series endpoint to pull back send specific analytics.

## Errors

The status code element of a server response is a 3-digit number where the first digit of the code defines the class of response.

- The **2XX class** of status code (non-fatal) indicates that **your request** was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
- The **4XX class** of status code (fatal) indicates a **client error**. Refer to the fatal errors chart for a full list of 4XX error codes and descriptions.
- The **5XX class** of status code (fatal) indicates a **server error**. When this happens, we recommend you retry your request with exponential backoff.

### Fatal errors

The following status codes and associated error messages will be returned if your request encounters a fatal error.

{% alert warning %}
All of the following error codes indicate that no messages will be sent.
