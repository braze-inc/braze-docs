<!--
This redirect folder is used to facilitate moving articles out of the hidden doc. By keeping the permalink the same and changing the layout to redirect, we're able to more elegantly pass users from their previous link for beta articles, etc., to the hidden doc site. Keeping the beta articles changed to redirects in the hidden folder just gives any competitor aware of the hidden folder information about the new site.
