# Filter options changed

Your filter options are related to the format (data type) that you’re passing to Braze for your custom attribute. To review the data type that Braze is recognizing for your custom attributes, navigate to **Manage Settings** then select the **Custom Attributes** tab.

If your filter options have changed, this is an indication that your data is being passed to Braze in a different format (data type) than before. For detailed descriptions of different data types and their filtering options, refer to our [Custom Attribute Data Types][36] documentation.

Please note that changing the data type of a custom attribute in the dashboard will reject data that is being sent to Braze in a different format.
