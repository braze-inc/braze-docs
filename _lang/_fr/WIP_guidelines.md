# Partnership Documentation

Welcome Braze Partners and thank you for contributing to our customer knowledge base. Creating and adding partner pages to the Braze docs repository can be quick and simple with the right tools and setup.

Partnership Documentation Overview
- [Set up Your Local Environment](#setup_env)
- [Create and Add Content to Your Page](#create_page)
- [Image, Link and Code Snippet Formatting](#image_links)
- [Reviewing and Testing](#testing)
- [Commiting to Github](#committing)
- [Review Process](#review)

{% alert important %}
Note that this partnership guide is for NEW Braze partners that __do not have existing documentation__ already hosted on our site. If you are an existing partner updating your documentation, navigate to your partner page located in: `braze-docs` -> `_docs` -> `_partners` and update your pages as you normally would.
{% endalert %}

## Step 1: Set up Your Local Environment {#setup_env}

To contribute to Braze docs, you must have a Github account with which you can commit changes and edits.

We recommend first __[forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) our GitHub repository__, and then creating a __local clone of your fork__:
1. Navigate to the main [braze-docs repo](https://github.com/Appboy/braze-docs), and click __Fork__ in the upper right corner of the page. <br><br>
2. Next, within this newly forked repo, click the green __Clone or download__ button. From the dialogue that appears, click __Use SSH__, and __save the repository link provided__ for step 3. <br><br>
3. Lastly, follow our Github Wiki Guide on how to set up your [local environment](https://github.com/Appboy/braze-docs/wiki/Set-Up-Your-Local-Environment#configuring-the-github-braze-docs-repo) __ommitting step 3 of the guide__, and instead, __using the repository link saved,__ to clone your forked repo.

After setting up your local environment, make sure to sign our [CLA](https://www.braze.com/docs/cla) (Contribution License Agreement), _this step is required_.

## Step 2: Create and Add Content to Your Page {#create_page}

To create your partner page, open the braze-docs repository and navigate to the `wip_partnerships` folder within the repo. <br>This folder can be found by following the file path: `braze-docs` -> `_docs` -> `_hidden` -> `wip_partnerships`.

Here, you will find a [Partnership Template]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/your_partner_name/). Next, create a folder, name it your partner name, copy this template into your folder, and get to work!

> Your file pathing should now look like this: `braze-docs` -> `_docs` -> `_hidden` -> `wip_partnerships` -> `partner_name` (folder) -> `partner.md`.

### Template Components

Your [Partnership Template]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/your_partner_name/) is composed of three main components, the metadata, the content, and the references.

{% tabs %}
{% tab MetaData %}
This information helps our Braze search properly find, label, and categorize your docs page.
```
---
nav_title: Your Partner Page
page_order: 1

description: "This is the Google Search and SEO description that will appear. Try to make this informative and concise, yet brief."
alias: /partners/your_partnership_name/

page_type: partner
search_tag: Partner
hidden: true
---
```

{% alert note %}
Note that we require you to fill out all metadata fields __except__ `page_order`, `page_type`, and `hidden`.
{% endalert %}

{% endtab %}
{% tab Content %}
This information is the meat of the document. Here you cover the prerequisites, integration steps, use cases, etc.. For more information on what to include in the content, check out our Partnership [Template]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/your_partner_name/) that breaks down what should be included.
```
# [Partner Name]

> Welcome to the Partner Page Template! Here, you'll find everything you need to create your partner page. In this first section, you should describe the partner in the first paragraph in a sentence or two. Also, include a link to that partner's main site.

In the second paragraph, you should explore and explain the relationship between Braze and this partner. This paragraph should explain how Braze and this partner work together to tighten the bond between the Braze User and their customer. Explain the "elevation" that occurs when a Braze User integrates with or leverages this partner and their services.

## Requirements or Prerequisites

This section is all about what you need to integrate with the partner and start using their services. The best way to deliver this information is with a quick instructional paragraph that describes any non-technical important details of "need to know" information, like whether or not your integration will be subject to additional security checks or clearances. Then, you should use a chart to describe the technical requirements of the integration.

{% alert important %}
The requirements listed below are typical requirements you might need from Braze. We recommend using the attributed titling, origin, links, and phrasing as listed in the chart below. Be sure to adjust the description so that you know what each of these requirements is used to do.
{% endalert %}

| Requirement | Origin | Access | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Braze API Key | Braze | You will need to create a new API Key.<br><br>This can be created in the __Developer Console -> API Settings -> Create New API Key__ with __users.track__ permissions. | This description should tell you what to do with the Braze API Key. |
| Braze REST Endpoint | Braze | [Braze REST Endpoint List][1] | Your REST Endpoint URL. Your endpoint will depend on the Braze URL for your instance. |

## [Type of Integration] Integration

This is where you break down the integration into steps. Do not just write endless paragraphs - these are technical documents... Continued in the Partnership Template.
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab References %}
This last section is located at the very end of your document. Here you will list out all references you need to links and images that you want to include in your document. Please see the next step on best practices for adding images and links to your doc.
```
[1]: https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/rest_api/basics/#endpoints
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Step 3: Image, Link and Code Snippet Formatting {#image_links}

Links and images are a necessary part of any integration document. They help supplement your instructions with helpful pictures, communicate information to users that might be hard or unnecessary to explain in words.

### Images

The higher quality of the images you can provide, the better. Images should not include important information such as API keys or employee names; we recommend burring information such as this out. Images should also be tightly cropped to display only useful information. When in doubt, include screenshots, as they can always be removed in the approval process.

To add images to your partner doc, you must place them in the `img` folder in our repository. This folder can be found by following the file path: `braze-docs` -> `assets` -> `img`.

Within this new folder, create a folder to keep your partnership images in. Name this folder your partner name.

!\[Braze Partner Folder\]\[1\]{: style="max-width:70%"}

To reference your images in your document, use the format listed below.

{% raw %}
```
![topic_name][1]
```
{% endraw %}

And at the end of your document, link out to your image.

{% raw %}
```
[1]: {% image_buster /assets/img/partner_file/image_name.png %}
```
{% endraw %}

### Links

To add links to your document, you must follow this format:
{% raw %}
```
For more information, check out [this website or page][1].
```
{% endraw %}

And at the end of your document, add your link.
{% raw %}
```
[1]: https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/onboarding_with_braze/integration/
```
{% endraw %}

### Liquid

Partner integrations often leverage our Liquid capabilities within the dashboard. If you plan on including Liquid code snippets, they must be wrapped between {&#37; raw &#37;} and {&#37; endraw &#37;} or you'll get a Liquid warning in markdown.
{% raw %}

{&#37; raw &#37;}<br> ?user_braze_id={{&#36;{braze_id}}}<br>
{&#37; endraw &#37;}

{% endraw %}
## Reviewing and Testing {#testing}

One of the most important things you can do before committing your changes is to test that everything looks and functions as it should. This can be done by running a `rake` command in your terminal.

In your terminal, you will see the command begin to work. This process may take several minutes. You will know when the command is done when you see "done in x seconds, press ctrl-c to stop" appear in the terminal.

Next, you can check your [localhost](http://localhost:4000/docs/).

Here you can navigate to the page that you created through the alias you assigned earlier. Once you open the localhost, append the alias to access your page.

Example: `http://localhost:4000/docs/` + `/partners/your_partner_name/`

Your page will be viewable at `http://localhost:4000/docs/partners/your_partner_name/`

Once you are done reviewing your edits, press Ctrl-C in the terminal, ending the rake command.

## Commiting to Github {#committing}

Once you have made the adequate changes to your partnership doc, save your document, and commit your changes.

Within the Braze docs GitHub repository, you will be able to find your branch. If your document is completed and ready to review, navigate to your forked repo in Github and select `New Pull Request`. Next, select how you would like your forked branch to be merged, name your request your partnership name and provide any relevant information that we can use to reference when reviewing your content.

1. Set up your branch to be merged in a similar fashion as shown below.<br>!\[Merge Branches\]\[2\]<br><br>
2. Name your Pull Request as "Partnership Name - Partner Docs"<br><br>
3. Provide any relevant information that can help the Braze documentation team confirm your changes, as well as your __Braze Product Manager__ so we can reach out to them to get in contact with you about your changes if needed.<br><br>
4. After you are done making changes, tag @KellieHawks and @Timothy-Kim in a comment within the PR, and our team will take a look.<br><br>

## Review Process {#review}

The review process may take several days to a week to get approved. We understand other companies and writers may have a different writing style than we do at Braze, so we will need time to make sure it aligns with the Braze voice and the specific formatting that we use.

Once the Pull Request has been approved by our writers, we will move it out of `wip_partnerships` to the correct location in our repository. Please note that we may not merge your documentation into our repository until given approval by the Braze partnership team. Reach out to your Braze partnership contact for an anticiapted release date.

And you are done! Thanks for contributing to Braze Docs!
