# January 2017

## New conversion events for email messages

You can now specify a conversion event for "opened email from campaign" or "clicked email from campaign." Learn more about conversion events and scheduling campaigns [here][16].

## CSV export with control group
When exporting a user campaign CSV, you can now include control groups in the data. Learn more about exporting dashboard data [here][17].

## Welcome/Double Opt-In Emails
You can now use a newly created “Added Email Address” action-based trigger—making it easy to send double opt-in or welcome emails when a user first adds their email address. Learn more about best practices for sending emails [here][18].

## List-Unsubscribe Email Header
You can now configureList-Unsubscribe headers that have a subscription status of "subscribed/opted in users" or "opted in users only." This adds an “Unsubscribe” link in Gmail next to the sender’s name, which can improve deliverability ratings.

## Usability updates
You can now click a button to minimize the Canvas header for smaller screens and hover over full names of your Canvases and campaigns on your user profile in Braze.
