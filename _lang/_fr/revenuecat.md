# RevenueCat

> RevenueCat is the single source of truth for your subscription status across iOS, Android, and web. Whether you are building a new app or already have millions of subscribers, you can use RevenueCat to build cross-platform in-app purchases, manage your products and subscribers, and analyze your data - no server code required.

The RevenueCat and Braze integration allows you to automatically sync your customer's purchase and subscription lifecycle events across platforms. This allows you to build campaigns that react to the subscription lifecycle stage of your customers, such as engaging with customers that opted out during their free trial or sending reminders to customers with billing issues. With accurate and up-to-date subscription data in Braze, you'll be set to turbocharge your campaigns.

## Requirements

At a minimum, you will need to enable the integration from the RevenueCat dashboard to connect RevenueCat to Braze. If you're using the Braze SDK, you can use the RevenueCat and Braze SDKs together to enhance the integration by ensuring the same customer identifier is being used in both systems.

## Server-to-Server Integration

### Step 1: Configure Braze Settings in RevenueCat

Navigate to your app in the RevenueCat dashboard, choose __Braze__ from the integrations menu, and add your Braze instance and Braze API key.

!\[braze_settings_in_revenuecat\]\[3\]

### Step 2: Configure Event Names in RevenueCat

Enter the event names that RevenueCat will send or select from the default event names by clicking **Use Default Event Names**. The events that RevenueCat supports sending are described below.

| Event                     | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial Purchase          | The first purchase of an auto-renewing subscription product that does not contain a free trial.                                                      |
| Trial Started             | The start of an auto-renewing subscription product free trial.                                                                                       |
| Trial Converted           | When an auto-renewing subscription product converts from a free trial to a normal paid period.                                                       |
| Trial Cancelled           | When a user turns off renewals for an auto-renewing subscription product during a free trial period.                                                 |
| Renewal                   | When an auto-renewing subscription product renews, or a user repurchases the auto-renewing subscription product after a lapse in their subscription. |
| Cancellation              | When a user turns off renewals for an auto-renewing subscription product during the normal paid period.                                              |
| Non Subscription Purchase | The purchase of any product that's not an auto-renewing subscription.                                                                                |
| Expiration                | When a subscription expires.                                                                                                                         |
| Billing Issue             | When there has been a problem trying to charge the user.                                                                                             |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

RevenueCat will automatically record this amount along with the event in Braze for events that have revenue, such as trial conversions and renewals.

### Step 3: Set Braze User Identity

In the Braze SDK, you can set the Braze User ID to match the RevenueCat App User ID. This way, events sent from the Braze SDK and RevenueCat can be synced to the same user.

Configure the Braze SDK with the same App User ID as RevenueCat or use the `.changeUser()` method on the Braze SDK.

#### (Optional) Send User Alias Object to Braze

If you want to send an alternative unique user identifier different from the RevenueCat App User ID, update users with the below data as RevenueCat subscriber attributes.

| Key                | Description                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `$brazeAliasName`  | The Braze `alias_name` in the [User Alias Object][2]  |
| `$brazeAliasLabel` | The Braze `alias_label` in the [User Alias Object][2] |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

Both attributes are required for the [User Alias Object][2] to be sent alongside your event data. These properties can be set manually, like any other [RevenueCat Subscriber Attribute][4].

{% tabs %}
{% tab swift %}
```swift
// Configure Purchases SDK
Purchases.configure(withAPIKey: "public_sdk_key", appUserID: "my_app_user_id")

// Change user in Braze SDK
Appboy.sharedInstance()?.changeUser("my_app_user_id")

// [Optional] Set User Alias Object attributes
Purchases.shared.setAttributes(["$brazeAliasName" : "alias_name", 
                             "$brazeAliasLabel" : "alias_label"])
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab objective-c %}
```objc
// Configure Purchases SDK
[RCPurchases configureWithAPIKey:@"public_sdk_key" appUserID:@"my_app_user_id"];

// Change user in Braze SDK
[[Appboy sharedInstance] changeUser:@"my_app_user_id"];

// [Optional] Set User Alias Object attributes
[[RCPurchases sharedPurchases] setAttributes:@{
    @"$brazeAliasName": @"alias_name",
    @"$brazeAliasLabel": @"alias_label"
}];
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab kotlin %}
```kotlin
// Configure Purchases SDK
Purchases.configure(this, "public_sdk_key", "my_app_user_id");

// Change user in Braze SDK
Braze.getInstance(this).changeUser("my_app_user_id");

// [Optional] Set User Alias Object attributes
Purchases.sharedInstance.setAttributes(mapOf("$brazeAliasName" to "alias_name",
                                             "$brazeAliasLabel" to "alias_label"));
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab java %}
```java
// Configure Purchases SDK
Purchases.configure(this, "public_sdk_key", "my_app_user_id");

// Change user in Braze SDK
Braze.getInstance(this).changeUser("my_app_user_id");

// [Optional] Set User Alias Object attributes
Map<String, String> attributes = new HashMap<String, String>();
attributes.put("$brazeAliasName", "alias_name");
attributes.put("$brazeAliasLabel", "alias_label");

Purchases.getSharedInstance().setAttributes(attributes);
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Customization

### Add a Sandbox API Key for Testing

Only production purchase events will be sent if you only provide one Braze REST API Key to RevenueCat. If you also want to send sandbox testing events, [create another Braze REST API Key][11] and add it to your Braze settings in RevenueCat.

## Using This Integration

After configuring Braze settings in RevenueCat, events will automatically begin flowing from RevenueCat to Braze without any other action on your part.

## Use Cases

- Trigger an onboarding campaign highlighting your premium features when a customer starts a free trial.
- Send a reminder to update billing information when a "Billing Issue" event is received.
- Send a feedback survey after a customer cancels a free trial.
