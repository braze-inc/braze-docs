# Neura Actions

> [Neura][1] helps leading mobile brands drive higher customer engagement and retention with AI-powered, real-world behavioral insights and advanced campaign segmentation and triggering.

The Neura and Braze integration allows you to create segments and audiences with Neura's [True Personas™][2] and trigger campaigns to reach users with [Neura Moments™][3].

Check out the [Neura Insights][4] Braze integration for further details on uncovering these real-world behavioral insights.

## Integration

To get started, ensure that both the Braze and Neura SDKs are properly integrated for both Android and iOS.

To integrate the Neura SDK, add short code snippets found in step 2 to your [AppDelegate on iOS][5] or [MainActivity class on Android][6]. You'll then begin receiving [Neura Moments™][3] as Braze custom events. You'll also gain the ability to segment users based on their real-world lifestyles and habits, [True Personas™][2], received as Braze custom attributes.

### Step 1: Add Braze in Neura

In the [Neura console][7], add a new mobile engagement platform. Here, you will be asked to provide the following information:

- API Key: The key you've created in the Braze platform.
- Region: Braze manages server endpoints in different regions. Use your region as the input to the "Server" field.
- Android/iOS App ID: We recommend providing a unique Braze application ID for each mobile platform, allowing you to segment the users for each platform individually.

### Step 2: Map Neura users to Braze

Next, ensure that Braze and Neura users are mapped to one another. To do this, create a user alias labeled `neura_id` with your user's neura_id and set a custom user attribute with the key-value pair `neura, true`.

{% tabs %}
  {% tab iOS %}
```objc
[[Appboy sharedInstance].user addAlias:NEURA_USER_ID withLabel:@"neura_id"];
[[Appboy sharedInstance].user setCustomAttributeWithKey:@"neura" andBOOLValue:true];
```
  {% endtab %}
  {% tab Android %}
```java
Braze.getInstance(YOUR_ACTIVITY.this).getCurrentUser().addAlias(NEURA_USER_ID, "neura_id");
Braze.getInstance(YOUR_ACTIVITY.this).getCurrentUser().setCustomUserAttribute("neura", true);
```
  {% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Lastly, make sure the External ID is set. Similarly to when the `changeUser` method is called in Braze (as soon as the user gets identified, generally after logging in, to set the user id), we recommend also setting the user ID as an External ID in Neura:

{% tabs %}
  {% tab iOS %}
```objc
NExternalId *externalIdObj = [[NExternalId alloc] initWithExternalId:@"USER_ID"];
NeuraSDK.shared.externalId = externalIdObj;
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Android %}
```java
mNeuraApiClient.setExternalId(USER_ID)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Using Neura in Braze

### Trigger Campaign

Once both SDKs are integrated, you can set up a campaign or Canvas in the Braze dashboard to be triggered by Neura Moments, available in the Braze platform as custom events.

### Create Braze segment

Neura recognizes real-world behavioral traits for each user. Using Braze, you can create segments to target specific users based on their True Personas™, available in the Braze platform as custom attributes.
