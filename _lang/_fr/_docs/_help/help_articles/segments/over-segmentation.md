# Over-Segmentation

Don't over-segment your tracking! Being more generic will help you target more users and draw more useful divisions between user segments.

For example, rather than capturing a separate event for watching each of 50 different movies, it would be more effective to capture simply watching a movie as an event.

If you over segment your user data, your findings will lose statistical significance and won’t guide the development of your app and marketing initiatives as effectively. When evaluating user-trend data, you can get too involved in the details of a problem to look at the situation as a whole.

Events should be tied directly to your marketing and conversion goals.

{% alert tip %}
Multiple user actions within an app can be labeled with the same custom event or attribute designation. This is useful when you want to track something generically such as "played a song" rather than recording each individual song within a music app as a separate and distinct event.
{% endalert %}
