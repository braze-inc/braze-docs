# Unreal Engine SDK

The Braze Unreal Engine plugin lets you integrate with Unreal Engine, a state-of-the-art real-time engine and editor. You can measure and engage with users on your iOS and Android apps built on Unreal Engine 4.

With this plugin, you can also:
* Measure and track sessions within your app or game
* Track in-app purchases and custom events
* Update user profiles with standard and custom attributes
* Send push notifications
* Integrate your Unreal apps with larger Canvas journeys
* Send cross-channel messaging, like email or SMS, based on in-app behavior
