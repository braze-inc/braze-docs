## Braze and Zeotap integration

### Step 1: Create a Zeotap destination for Braze

1. From the Zeotap Unity platform, navigate to the __DESTINATIONS__ application.
2. Under __All Channels__, search for Braze.
3. Select Braze and in the prompt that appears, enter the destination name, client name, and API key associated with your Braze account.
4. Select the Braze REST endpoint instance and save the destination. <br><br>!\[Zeotap Braze destination\]\[1\]

### Step 2: Create and link a Zeotap segment to your destination

1. From the Zeotap Unity platform, navigate to the __CONNECT__ application.
2. Create a segment and push it to Braze.
3. Select the associated output identifier.<br><br>The supported output identifiers for this integration include MAID, sha56 email, and sha56 phone.<br><br>Only one of these identifiers can be used for the Braze integration. These identifiers must be the same as the external ID set when collecting data using the Braze SDK.
4. Click __Yes__ to activate the segment.

!\[Zeotap segment\]\[2\]

{% alert note %}
The identifiers that appear in the window are the ones that are both available in the segment and supported by Braze.
{% endalert %}

### Step 3: Create Braze segment

After successfully creating, pushing, and processing a segment in Zeotap, the Zeotap users will appear in the Braze dashboard. You can look up users by user ID in the Braze dashboard.

!\[Zeotap user profile\]\[4\]

If a user is part of the Zeotap Segment, the segment name appears as a custom attribute on their user profile with the boolean value `true`. Take note of the customer attribute name as you will need it when creating a Braze segment.

Next, you must create and define this segment within Braze by performing the following steps:
1. From the Braze dashboard, select __Segments__ and then __Create Segment__.
2. Next, name your segment and select the custom attribute segment that was made in Zeotap.
3. Save your changes.

!\[Braze segment\]\[3\]

You can add this newly created segment to future Braze campaigns and Canvases to target these end-users.
