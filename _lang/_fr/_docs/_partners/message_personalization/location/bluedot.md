# Bluedot

> [Bluedot](https://bluedot.io/) is a location platform that provides an accurate and straightforward geofencing platform for your apps. Use Bluedot's SDK to message smarter, automate mobile order check-ins, optimize workflows, and create frictionless experiences.

The Braze and Bluedot integration allows you to use Bluedot geofence location services to create user events that can be used to build journeys, campaigns and analyze customers' behaviors and interests. Events (entry/exit) generated by the user on their device are sent immediately to Braze with all relevant information.

## Use cases

The custom event location information provided by Bluedot can be used in your campaigns to achieve common use cases like:
- [`QSR`](https://bluedot.io/solutions/quick-service-restaurants/) (Quick Service Restaurant)
- [`Click and Collect`](https://bluedot.io/solutions/click-and-collect/)
- [`Drive-Thru`](https://bluedot.io/solutions/qsr-drive-thru/)

## Integration

### Step 1: Create a Bluedot project
Set up your Bluedot account and log into your [Bluedot Canvas dashboard](https://docs.bluedot.io/canvas/). Visit the [Bluedot documentation]((https://docs.bluedot.io/canvas/creating-a-new-project/)) to learn how to create a new project.

### Step 2: Integrate the SDKs
Integrate the Bluedot Point SDK and the Braze SDK in your app using the steps provided in the [Bluedot-Braze integration](https://docs.bluedot.io/integrations/braze-integration/) documentation.

### Step 3: Autheticate the Bluedot SDK
Use the `projectId` created in step 1 to authenticate the Bluedot Point SDK.

### Step 4: Use Bluedot events in Braze

#### Triggering Messages

You can set up a push campaign or Canvas that will action off of location events generated by the Bluedot SDK. This integration route is ideal for real-time messaging right as users enter a venue or location of interest or delayed follow-on communication after they've left.

Set up an action-based campaign within Braze that will send messages based on a set location. For your trigger, use a custom event of `bluedot_entry` or `bluedot_exit` as shown below:

#### Targeting users

Make sure to target **All Users** for your app group. ![Bluedot Campaign Compose]({%image_buster /assets/img_archive/Campaign-Target_users-BD.png %}){: style="max-width:80%"}
