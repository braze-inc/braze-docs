## Change "empty feed" language

You can change the language that appears automatically in empty Content Card feeds by [redefining the localizable content card strings](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/blob/3cca65b06f66085f5bc7c8e1ad267bf8bb1f0da7/AppboyUI/ABKContentCards/Resources/en.lproj/AppboyContentCardsLocalizable.strings) in your appâ€™s localizable strings file:
```
"Appboy.content-cards.no-card.text" = "No Cards!!!!";
"Appboy.content-cards.done-button.title" = "Done";
"Appboy.content-cards.no-card.text" = "We have no updates.\nPlease check again later.";
"Appboy.content-cards.no-connection.title" = "Connection Error";
"Appboy.content-cards.no-connection.message" = "Cannot establish network connection.\nPlease try again later.";
```
{% alert note %}
If you want to update it for different languages, find the corresponding language in [the Resources folder structure](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/tree/3cca65b06f66085f5bc7c8e1ad267bf8bb1f0da7/AppboyUI/ABKContentCards/Resources) with the same string `Appboy.content-cards.no-card.text`.
{% endalert %}
