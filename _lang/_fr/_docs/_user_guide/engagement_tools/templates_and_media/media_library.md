You can use the **Media Library** to:

* Upload multiple images at one time
* Upload Virtual Contact Files (.vcf)
* Upload a folder with your images (max: 50 images)
* Crop an existing image to create the right ratio for your messages
* Add tags or teams to help further organize your images
* Search by tags or teams in the new Media Library grid
* Drag and drop images or folders to be uploaded
* Delete images

## Stats available

Within the Media Library, you can see the image dimensions, URL, type as well as the date it was added to the library.

## Accessing the Media Library from a message composer

The Media Library acts as your dashboard's centralized location for assets, as all images are uploaded directly to it. This functionality gives you the flexibility to re-use images across different messages.

## Managing content

You can also [duplicate]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/duplicate/) and [archive]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/archive/) templates!
