# Message Step

Message Steps allow you to add a standalone message where you want in your Canvas flow.

{% alert important %}
Canvas Message Steps are currently in early access. Please contact your Braze account manager if you are interested in participating in the early access.
{% endalert %}

## Create a Message Step

!\[Canvas Message Step\]\[1\]{: style="float:right;max-width:19%;margin-left:15px;"}

To create a Message Step, add a step to your Canvas. Then, use the drop-down at the top of the new step to select **Message**.

With a Message Step, all users who enter the step advance to the next step when any one of the following conditions is met:
- Any message is sent
- A message is not sent because the user is not reachable with a channel
- A message is not sent because it is frequency capped
- A message is not sent because it is aborted

The Message Step also includes settings for Intelligent Delivery and Quiet Hours overrides.

The Message Step allows you to enable Intelligent Timing with a fallback option when a userâ€™s profile does not have enough data to calculate an optimal time. Select **Using Intelligent Timing** in **Delivery Settings**. Here, you can select either the most popular time or a specific fallback time.

If Quiet Hours are enabled, the Message Step also allows you to override this setting.

{% alert note %}
For Canvas Message Steps, `event_properties` are not supported. Instead, use `canvas_entry_properties`.
