## Two-way messaging (custom keyword responses)

Two-way messaging allows you to send messages and process the responses to those messages. It requires end-users to send a keyword to Braze, to which that user will receive an automatic reply. Applied correctly, two-way messaging can be a simple, immediate, and dynamic solution to customer marketing, saving time and resources along the way.

## Managing keywords and auto responses

SMS with Braze gives you the option to create keyword triggers, custom responses, define keyword sets for multiple languages, and establish custom keyword categories.

{% tab Add Keyword Triggers %}

#### Add keyword triggers

In addition to the default opt-in and opt-out keywords listed above, you may also define your own keywords to trigger Opt-In, Opt-Out, and Help responses.

![Home]({% image_buster /assets/img/sms/keyword_edit2.png %}){: style="float:right;max-width:40%;margin-left:10px;"}
1. To define your own keywords, navigate to the SMS section of the dashboard located under Subscription Groups.<br><br>
2. Under SMS Global Keywords, select a keyword category to add a keyword to by selecting the pencil icon.<br><br>
3. In the dialogue box that pops up, add a keyword you would like to trigger this keyword category. Note that keywords are case sensitive, and universal keywords like `START`, `YES`, and `UNSTOP` cannot be changed. Please read the rules below that apply to keywords and keyword responses.<br><br>![picture]({% image_buster /assets/img/sms/sms_keywords.png %})

{% tab Manage Responses %}

#### Manage responses

You are able to manage your own responses that get sent to users after they text in a keyword to a specific keyword category.

![Home]({% image_buster /assets/img/sms/keyword_edit2.png %}){: style="float:right;max-width:40%;margin-left:10px;"}
1. To manage your keyword responses, navigate to the SMS section of the dashboard located under Subscription Groups. <br><br>
2. Under SMS Global Keywords, select a keyword category to edit a response for by selecting the pencil icon.<br><br>
3. In the dialogue box that pops up, edit and save your response. Please be mindful of the [Six Rules to get Compliance Right]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/sms_laws_and_regulations/#the-six-rules-to-get-compliance-right) as you create your response and read the rules below that apply to keywords and keyword responses.<br><br> ![Responses]({% image_buster /assets/img/sms/keyword_home.png %})

| Keywords                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Keyword Responses                                                                              |

## Multi-language support

When sending to certain countries, a sender may be required to support inbound keywords and outbound replies with a local language. To support this, Braze allows you to create a language-specific keyword setting.

!\[picture\]\[16\]{: style="float:right;max-width:40%;margin-left:10px;"} To get started, click "Add A Language" and select your target language or search for a language within the dropdown.

Please note that other languages do NOT come with preset keywords/responses like English, so senders will need to work with their marketing and legal teams to add any required keywords to this set. Otherwise, Braze will not handle localized incoming messages for those languages. If you need to delete a language, click the "Delete Language" button at the bottom right.

## Custom keyword categories

In addition to the three default keyword categories (Opt-in, Opt-out, and Help), you are also able to create up to 10 of your own keyword categories. This allows you to identify arbitrary keywords and set up responses specific to your business. An example category might be "PROMO" or "DISCOUNT" which might prompt a response about promos that are happening this month.

These custom keywords operate in an "always-on" capacity, meaning that any user subscribed to your message service can text keywords and receive a response at any point. In addition to this behavior, you also have the option to define specific keywords that can only be sent to at [certain points]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/keywords/keyword_handling/#lifecycle-specific-keywords) of your user's lifecycle.

!\[picture\]\[12\]

### Create a custom category

!\[picture\]\[13\]{: style="float:right;max-width:40%;margin-left:10px;"} To create a custom keyword category, edit the appropriate subscription group, and click "Add Custom Keyword Category". Here, you will be able to provide a keyword category name and define which keywords a user can text in to receive the reply message.

Once created, this keyword category will be available to [filter and trigger]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/campaign/retargeting/) against in your campaigns and Canvases.

Keywords created in custom keyword categories adhere to all of the rules and validations stated above for the creation of new keywords.

### Lifecycle-specific keywords

If you have a use case where you would like to limit when a customer can send a specific keyword during their lifecycle (e.g., during their first initial onboarding) to receive a response, you can use the trigger "Sent inbound SMS to subscription group within keyword category OTHER" in your campaign/Canvas and define some ad-hoc keywords that your users can send in at a point in time. This trigger supports filtering on the specific inbound message using is/is not comparisons of the message, as well as matches/does not match regex rules to validate the user's input.

#### Canvas

!\[picture\]\[14\]{: style="max-width:80%;"}

#### Campaign

!\[picture\]\[15\]{: style="max-width:80%;"}

### Dealing with unknown keywords

While not required, we strongly recommend setting up an auto-response for when users send inbound SMS keywords that do not match an existing keyword. This message will notify the user that the keyword is not recognized and offer some guidance.

This can be done by creating an SMS campaign with a message like "Sorry! We didn't recognize that keyword, text STOP to stop or HELP to help." Next, in the delivery step, select "Action-Based Delivery" and use the trigger "Sent inbound SMS to subscription group within keyword category OTHER".
