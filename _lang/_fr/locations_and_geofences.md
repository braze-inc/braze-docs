guide_top_text: "The ubiquity and flexibility of mobile technology allows marketers, product managers, and growth teams to reach their users everywhere, blurring the lines between digital and real-world experiences. With Braze, you can create and enhance relationships with your users based upon their location in the real world, unlocking a powerful set of deeply connected interactions:<br><br>\n- Upload the locations of all of your brands' brick and mortar stores, and send push notifications to loyal users notifying them of in-store promotions if they pass nearby. <br> \n- Upload the location of an upcoming concert, and message users letting them know where to register when they reach the venue. Then, follow up with a thank you message an hour after they depart. <br>\n<br>You can gather and utilize user location data in a couple of ways: <br><br>\n- When a user opens your app, <strong>location tracking</strong> captures their most recent locations using GPS location data. This allows you to see where your users have been and segment this data.<br>\n- <strong>Geofences</strong> are defined virtual geographic areas. If a user has enabled background location tracking, you can use geofences to trigger campaigns in real-time when a user is in a geofence. Geofences are only available in select Braze packages. For access, please reach out to your Braze representative."
